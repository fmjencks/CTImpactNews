According to data from the global organization Climate TRACE, La Plata

Ensenada and Berisso) is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions in Argentina, primarily due to its industrial and energy activity. This is confirmed daily with updated imagery estimates. In this sense, it provides an important database.

Although recent studies indicate that industrial air pollution levels have shown ocasional decreases in previous years, the climate organization's

monitoring allows for the precise identification of sources that still exceed recommended thresholds in the region. Furthermore, the petrochemical industry, the vehicle fleet, and solid waste management in Greater La Plata contribute to the emissions profile that the platform tracks using remote sensors, allowing for the visualization of emissions at the level of individual facilities (such as specific power plants or refineries). This positions Greater La Plata as a key area of observation for mitigation policies in the country.

The importance of air pollution in the Region, analyzed through this tool and local studies, is expressed in the following key points:

EMISSION HOTSPOTS IN GREATER LA PLATA

Climate TRACE identifies specific assets (factories, refineries and power plants, see map) that contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and local pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5).

Industrial Sector: The area encompassing La Plata, Berisso and Ensenada concentrates one of the most important petrochemical hubs in Argentina, which is a critical point of CO2 emissions and other toxic gases.

Transportation: This is one of the sectors with the highest growth in emissions. Globally, data from August 2025 showed a 3.60% increase in this sector compared to the previous year, a trend reflected in dense urban areas like La Plata.

IMPACT ON HEALTH AND AIR QUALITY

The platform has introduced tools to visualize ""pollution plumes"", allowing you to see how PM2.5 from industrial sources moves towards communities (see image).

Toxic gases: In La Plata, levels of nitrogen dioxide and other gases that directly affect the respiratory health of the population and contribute to smog are monitored.

Local risks: Studies by UNLP and CONICET have indicated that, although there were temporary decreases in pollution in previous years, the City faces constant challenges due to air quality and water source pollution.

Emissions trend : Global GHG emissions have continued to increase slightly (0.55% higher than in 2024), putting pressure on industrial cities like La Plata to improve their efficiency. Health impact: Levels of nitrogen dioxide and other particulate matter are critical factors affecting public health in the region.

Mitigation Capacity : A relevant fact is that the forest heritage of the National University of La Plata (UNLP) manages to absorb a large part of the carbon emissions that the institution itself generates, although the balance for the entire City and its surroundings continues to depend on massive industrial emissions.

EFFECTS AND CONSEQUENCES

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution consists of airborne particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, capable of penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream. These particles originate primarily from combustion (cars, industry, fires, wood burning), causing heart disease, asthma, lung cancer, and serious respiratory problems.

The Climate TRACE organization identifies specific assets (factories, refineries, and power plants) that contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and local pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5), verifying these levels using remote sensors that identify pollutant emissions. And as detailed in yesterday's edition, not only industrial emissions in our area but also those caused by the vehicle fleet and solid waste management.

In terms of local risks, it should be noted that studies by the National University of La Plata (UNLP) and CONICET indicated that, although there were temporary decreases in pollution in previous years, the city faces constant challenges in terms of air quality and water source pollution. In La Plata, levels of nitrogen dioxide and other toxic gases that directly affect the respiratory health of the population and contribute to smog were monitored.

With regard to the region's industrial sector, the study found that it is home to one of Argentina's most important petrochemical hubs, which is a critical source of CO2 and other toxic gas emissions. As for the automotive transport sector, it was considered to be ""one of the sectors with the highest growth in emissions.""

As context for this monitoring, it is worth noting recent statements by the World Health Organization revealing that 93 percent of children under the age of 15 worldwide (1.8 billion children) breathe air that is ""so polluted that it puts their health and development at risk.""

The organization estimated in 2016 that some 600,000 children died from acute respiratory infections.

The work reflected here certainly fills a scientific gap in the region, which lacks sufficient, necessary, and up-to-date technical studies on the quality of the air that the population breathes.

La Plata, Berisso and Ensenada under scrutiny: satellites reveal critical levels of pollution exceeding recommended limits. 13
Greater La Plata , which includes the municipalities of La Plata, Berisso and Ensenada, was listed as one of the most polluted areas in Argentina, according to data from the international monitoring platform Climate TRACE , which uses artificial intelligence and satellite technology to track greenhouse gas emissions globally.

Contents in the news
The system, co-founded by former US Vice President Al Gore , identified the petrochemical hub , the transport sector, and solid waste management as the main sources of air pollution in the region, posing serious risks to the public health of the inhabitants.

Technical analysis reveals that pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) far exceed the thresholds recommended by international organizations, exposing the population to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer .

Three sectors responsible for the pollutant emissions profile
La Plata, Berisso and Ensenada under scrutiny: satellites reveal critical levels of pollution exceeding recommended limits.

The Greater La Plata region presents a complex environmental scenario, dominated by three main sectors that contribute significantly to the deterioration of air quality .

First, the petrochemical complex encompassing La Plata, Berisso, and Ensenada, identified as a hotspot for carbon dioxide and other toxic gas emissions, represents one of the main environmental threats. This industrial complex houses the YPF refinery and distillery, steel companies, and thermoelectric power plants, among other high-impact facilities.

The second factor is the transportation sector , which shows sustained growth in its emissions. Data from August 2025 showed a year-on-year increase of 3.60% in overall emissions from the transportation sector, a trend that is replicated in densely populated urban areas like the capital of Buenos Aires province, where the growing vehicle fleet exacerbates the situation. According to information published by La Plata CONICET , more than 57 vehicles per day were added to the city's vehicle fleet in 2017.

The management of municipal solid waste completes the picture of polluting sources, contributing significantly to the region's overall emissions profile.

The invisible threat: microscopic particles with devastating impact
La Plata, Berisso and Ensenada under scrutiny: satellites reveal critical levels of pollution exceeding recommended limits.

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the most concerning pollutant for human health. These are particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, invisible to the naked eye, which come mainly from vehicle emissions, industrial activity, fires, and wood burning.

The danger of these particles lies in their microscopic size, which allows them to evade the body's natural defenses. According to the technical documentation analyzed, these particles are ""capable of penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream, causing heart disease, asthma, lung cancer, and serious respiratory problems . ""


Recent research expands the list of health problems associated with PM2.5 exposure, including kidney disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and pregnancy complications. International studies cited by ABC News link air pollution to approximately 9 million premature deaths annually worldwide.


Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) , another key pollutant monitored in La Plata, directly affects the respiratory health of the population and is a fundamental component in the formation of urban smog that can be seen on the city's horizon.

Satellite technology reveals the journey of pollution
La Plata, Berisso and Ensenada under scrutiny: satellites reveal critical levels of pollution exceeding recommended limits. 14

One of Climate TRACE 's most innovative tools allows you to visualize so-called ""pollution plumes ,"" animated representations that show how particulate matter generated by industrial sources travels with the wind from its origin to inhabited areas.

According to information from Radio La Plata , the platform released a map showing the plume of pollution generated by the emissions being carried by the wind, directly affecting nearby communities.


The system uses data from approximately 300 satellites and more than 30,000 monitoring stations, processed using artificial intelligence to identify emissions at the individual facility level. This unprecedented granularity allows researchers to observe how specific power plants or refineries contribute to pollution that directly affects neighborhoods and homes in La Plata, Berisso, and Ensenada.

Local studies confirm the structural challenge
La Plata, Berisso and Ensenada under scrutiny: satellites reveal critical levels of pollution exceeding recommended limits.

Research conducted by the National University of La Plata (UNLP) and CONICET has provided relevant data on the evolution of pollution in the region. According to a publication by CONICET La Plata , fellow Daniela Giuliani presented a doctoral study on air pollution that included analyses in three zones: industrial, urban, and residential.

The results are conclusive: particulate matter levels in the industrial zone exceed those in the urban zone, and both of these are higher than those in the residential zone. However, the most alarming finding comes from the comparison with international standards. While a percentage of the measurements comply with Buenos Aires regulations, 79% of the annual average particulate matter levels in the air of Greater La Plata exceed the maximum limits recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) .


Previous studies have indicated temporary or one-off decreases in industrial air pollution in previous years. However, these same studies warn that air quality remains a constant and structural challenge for the city.


One positive aspect is the UNLP's forest resources, which absorb a large portion of the carbon emissions generated by the institution itself. However, this mitigation effort is insufficient given the volume of massive industrial emissions from the petrochemical complex, which keeps the region's overall carbon balance in negative territory.

Global context and worrying trends
The situation in Greater La Plata is framed within a global context that shows no signs of significant improvement. Global greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise in 2025, with an estimated increase of 0.55% compared to 2024.

The transport sector represents one of the biggest challenges, with a 3.6% increase in its emissions worldwide, putting additional pressure on densely populated urban centers like Greater La Plata.

Climate TRACE: radical transparency in emissions
La Plata, Berisso and Ensenada under scrutiny: satellites reveal critical levels of pollution exceeding recommended limits.

Climate TRACE (Tracking Real-time Atmospheric Carbon Emissions) is a global coalition made up of NGOs, technology companies and universities, co-founded by Al Gore , former US Vice President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate.

According to WattTime , the project began in 2019 with a grant from Google.org to monitor emissions from power plants from space. Climate TRACE was formally launched in July 2020 and now brings together more than 100 collaborating organizations.


The platform uses artificial intelligence and satellite data to monitor emissions worldwide at the individual asset level. Its goal is to provide detailed and independent data to accelerate climate action, limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C, and foster more sustainable development.

In September 2025, Climate TRACE expanded its system to track not only greenhouse gases , but also fine particulate matter pollutants that cause millions of deaths annually, monitoring more than 660 million pollution sources globally, as reported by TechCrunch .

Implications for public policy
The region's capacity to mitigate these emissions on a large scale is limited, positioning Greater La Plata as a key observation area for the design of environmental policies at the provincial and national levels.

The availability of accurate and up-to-date data on emissions at the individual facility level represents a fundamental tool for authorities, investors and communities to demand accountability from those responsible for pollution.


The Buenos Aires air quality regulations, amended in 2018, incorporated the regulation of PM2.5, which was not included in the original 1996 document. However, experts point out that the permitted levels have not been updated and urgently need to be to align with international standards.

The pending challenge
The data presented by Climate TRACE removes the abstraction of the air pollution problem , offering concrete visualizations of pollution plumes moving from the petrochemical hub to residential areas, of invisible particles that threaten the health of thousands of inhabitants, and of an environmental challenge that exceeds local mitigation efforts.

Satellite technology and artificial intelligence have made the invisible visible, providing the community with tools to understand the magnitude of the problem and demand concrete solutions from the relevant authorities and the industries responsible for emissions.


The question that emerges from this technical analysis is clear: with irrefutable scientific evidence on the levels of pollution and their specific sources, what measures will local and provincial authorities implement to protect the health of the inhabitants of Greater La Plata?",https://elcorreografico.com.ar/la-plata-berisso-ensenada-contaminacion/
BIH,"Climate TRACE data are used to quantify and contextualize emissions from a major steel facility identified as the Smederevo Steel Plant, using comparisons to large regional emitters such as the Nikola Tesla, Kostolac, and Kolubara thermal power plants and the Pančevo refinery. The reporting focuses on attribution and scale rather than on documented follow‑on actions.",The steel plant emits about two million tons of carbon dioxide per year.,Podunavlje.info,"November 8, 2025","According to data from the Climate TRACE website, the Smederevo Steel Plant emitted 1.96 million tons of CO2 into the air last year, ranking third in Serbia and 352nd out of 951 largest carbon dioxide emitters in the world in that industry. For this year, the data varies, depending on the month, between 115 and 200 tons, depending on production at the steel milli and, if it's any consolation, they are much lower than they were in, say, 2021 and 2022. Honestly, this is less than the world average, where the steel industry accounts for 7-8 percent of total emissions of so-called greenhouse gases. The problem is that CO2 is just one of the things that come out of the chimneys of the local steel mill, but let's just dwell on that, another time we'll talk about the other things that the plants from Radinac ""honor"" us with. Compared to the first two CO2 emitters on this list when it comes to Serbia, the Smederevo steel plant is even a ""tiny child"". Namely, in Serbia, thermal power plants are at the top of the list; the Nikola Tesla Thermal Power Plant (TENT) is unrivaled, with its 15.59 million tons of CO2 in 2024, followed by the Kostolac Thermal Power Plant with 6.92 million. Now, this makes the bad situation even worse for Smederevo, especially when other by-products of the thermal power plants enter the equation. A look at the map, published by the website klima101.rs, clearly shows that Smederevo is in the middle, between TENT and Kostolac, and there are three emitters to the southwest, the fourth-placed Kolubara thermal power plant to the southeast, and the Pancevo Refinery to the northwest. If someone had drawn Smederevo's more awkward position when it comes to CO 2 emitters, they would have hardly succeeded. By the way, China has the largest emission in the world, producing more than a quarter of the world's CO2.*, in second place is the United States of America with about 11 percent, India in third, Russia in fourth... Serbia is in 95th place out of 252 countries that are subject to recording, but carbon dioxide production per capita in our country is higher than the world average. Finally, so that there is no ""where did you get all these numbers from"", the Climate TRACE portal is run by a non-profit coalition of organizations that uses data from more than 300 satellites and sensors and processes them with the help of artificial intelligence to obtain results from over 660 million pollution sources around the world, and the website klima101.rs publishes data that is checked by a team of scientific collaborators, and their work is supported by the European Climate Foundation . * Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is harmful in high concentrations, because in closed spaces it can cause headaches, dizziness, breathing problems, and at a concentration of 8-10% it can lead to unconsciousness and death. Because, as a gas, it is heavier than air and can displace oxygen. Globally, as a greenhouse gas, CO 2 contributes to global warming. The current concentration of CO z in the atmosphere is around 420 ppm (parts per million), a significant increase from the pre-industrial period of around 280 ppm.",https://www-podunavlje-info.translate.goog/dir/2025/11/08/zelezara-u-smederevu-emituje-oko-dva-miliona-tona-ugljen-dioksida/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp

The dynamic is simple: for much of the year, the vegetation remains dry, but when the rains arrive, the Caatinga enters an accelerated growth cycle, capturing more CO₂ from the atmosphere and functioning as a ""green lung"" in the middle of the semi-arid region.

Gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), or nitrous oxide (N2O), for example, have the ability to retain heat in the atmosphere, causing it to warm and altering the planet's climate patterns. Quantifying and understanding the origins of these emissions is, therefore, a fundamental step in guiding the development of public policies and actions that seek to reduce these releases and mitigate their effects on the global climate. In recent years, nations, economic sectors, and organizations have been developing inventories to document the volume and profile of productive activities responsible for these releases, with the aim of minimizing them and offsetting this impact. In general, the amount of gases emitted into the atmosphere is a balance formed by the volume emitted from activities minus the carbon that is recovered, for example, by natural activities such as plant photosynthesis. An article produced by researchers from the Faculty of Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences (FCAV) at Unesp, on the Jaboticabal campus, investigated the impact of carbon removal on the Brazilian greenhouse gas inventory and pointed to the central role of the Caatinga in this process. According to the study, in some years the northeastern biome, despite occupying approximately 10% of the national territory, accounted for almost 50% of all carbon capture carried out in the country. The analysis conducted by researcher Luís Miguel da Costa, alongside Professor Newton La Scala Jr., shows that the Caatinga surpasses other biomes more celebrated for their environmental services, such as the Amazon and the Cerrado – at least in the period between 2015 and 2022, the time interval investigated by the research team. The work was published in the journal Science of the Total Environment . The research compared data from two of the main sources of information on greenhouse gas emissions and removals available for Brazil today: the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimation System (SEEG), coordinated by Brazilian institutions such as the Climate Observatory, and Climate TRACE , an international consortium that uses satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to monitor emissions across the planet in near real-time. In addition to focusing on Brazilian biomes, the study also included the analysis of satellite data on precipitation and chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). Chlorophyll fluorescence is a direct indicator of the photosynthetic activity of vegetation; that is, the more intense the SIF, the greater the sequestration of atmospheric carbon by plants. According to the study's authors, what occurs in the Caatinga is that the increased availability of water during periods of abundant rainfall is reflected in a very positive response from the photosynthetic process. “We had previously conducted a specific study on the SIF (Synthetic Factor Index) for all six Brazilian biomes. In the Amazon, for example, we found that there is practically a plateau, a maximum level. However, when we analyzed photosynthetic activity in relation to precipitation in the Caatinga, we observed a very large increase in the SIF in those years when rainfall exceeds the biome's averages,” explains the researcher. According to the data presented now, Scala Jr. says that the Amazon remains an immense carbon reservoir, whose preservation is fundamental. The Caatinga, on the other hand, caught the researchers' attention by demonstrating a significant capacity to capture carbon, related to its vegetation's ability to respond positively to certain environmental factors, such as rainfall. ""These are different characteristics, but equally important,"" affirms the professor from the Jaboticabal campus. The rapid regrowth of plants is a unique attribute that makes the biome function as a significant carbon sink, even during relatively short periods of improved climate. The dry vegetation, which predominates for much of the year, enters a cycle of accelerated growth as soon as the rains arrive, sequestering large amounts of CO₂ from the atmosphere, about 40% of the country's removals, according to studies already conducted in the region. Deforestation is the main culprit behind Brazilian emissions. As the authors of the article explain, Brazilian emissions are entirely associated with changes in land use and occupation. Agriculture emerges as the second largest emitting sector, followed by the energy sector. According to official data from SEEG itself, gross Brazilian GHG emissions in 2023 totaled approximately 2.3 billion tons of CO₂ equivalent (or 2.3 GtCO₂e), representing a reduction of about 12% compared to the previous year, when the total was 2.6 GtCO₂e [ see image below ]. The term ""equivalent,"" in this case, is used when the calculation refers to all gases that cause the greenhouse effect, in terms equivalent to CO₂. Recently, official data released by the DETER system , a tool from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) that monitors changes in the country's forest cover, indicated a 33% reduction in deforestation in the first half of 2023, compared to 2022, and a 21% increase in the Cerrado during the same period. Most of the deforestation in the biome occurs in the deforestation arc, near the Amazon, and also in the region called Matopiba (the northern portion of the biome that encompasses the states of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí, and Bahia). Net emissions from land use and forests, that is, the deforestation balance, reached approximately 1.8 GtCO₂e in the 1990s. However, due to strengthened environmental enforcement, this emissions balance fell to approximately 0.2 GtCO₂e in 2012. After that year, emissions began to rise again, placing Brazil, at best, as the last among the ten largest global emitters in this category. The increasing fires and deforestation in areas of both the Amazon and the Cerrado have helped to boost these numbers. Comparison between inventories reveals a difference of up to 1 GtCO₂e. The comparison made by the Jaboticabal group between the two inventories, SEEG and Climate TRACE, revealed significant differences in the estimates of carbon removal in the Brazilian land use and forestry sector. In some years, the divergence reaches 1 billion tons of CO₂ equivalent, which represents approximately 44% of all national emissions in 2023. “Climate TRACE is able to see the climatic variations on vegetation more clearly. However, both are important, depending on the answers one intends to obtain,” explains Costa. Methodological differences and the profile of the data used by each tool help explain the difference in the numbers. The researcher clarifies that while Climate TRACE uses artificial intelligence algorithms and remote sensing data in its calculations, SEEG considers information such as land use type, the extent of forested areas, and deforestation data. However, the Brazilian inventory does not dynamically incorporate the direct effects of climate variations on vegetation. The TRACE methodology is also based on emission factors defined by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), a UN body that publishes periodic reports on the state of climate change on the planet and consolidates global research on the subject. According to the researchers, this methodological difference explains why the international system identified significant increases in carbon removal in years with higher rainfall, as occurred in the Caatinga between 2021 and 2022. During this period, SIF data corroborate the significant increase in photosynthetic activity in the semi-arid region, which was reflected in the jump in carbon removal estimates in the international database. SEEG, in turn, presents more stable estimates over the years, as it does not react directly to this climate variability. “The important difference is that in the case of Climate Trace, when rain falls on a specific static forest quadrant, the biomass in that area increases, and it has sufficient sensitivity to capture this increase. SEEG, on the other hand, captures important agricultural activities, such as liming, a soil correction strategy practiced by rural producers that is a significant source of emissions,” explains La Scala Jr. The information, recorded by Climate Trace, that the Caatinga was responsible for 48% of all gross carbon removal recorded in Brazil in 2022 highlights a surprising contribution for a biome that historically receives less investment in conservation and monitoring. It is also a paradigm shift in relation to the common perception of the Caatinga, often seen as a region poor in biodiversity and with a low capacity to provide ecosystem services. Different methodologies, but both necessary. The comparison between SEEG and Climate TRACE also highlights the importance of advancing the integration of methodologies. Each system has strengths: SEEG is recognized for its transparency, data traceability, and alignment with international climate reporting standards. Climate TRACE, on the other hand, stands out for its more dynamic and responsive recording of vegetation behavior. Despite their distinct approaches, the two systems show convergence in general emission patterns in some regions, such as the Amazon. However, in other areas—such as the Caatinga—Climate TRACE detects significant net carbon removals, which do not appear with the same clarity in SEEG. These divergences highlight the need for harmonization between methodologies and reinforce the value of complementary studies such as that of the Unesp researchers, with multiple data sources. While the entire Brazilian biome plays a significant role in carbon removal—including the much-ailed Atlantic Forest—the data leaves no doubt about the strategic importance of the Caatinga as a carbon sink in the Brazilian context. For researchers at UNESP in Jaboticabal, these results reinforce the urgency of public policies focused on the conservation and recovery of native vegetation in the Caatinga. Such actions can significantly increase Brazil's contribution to removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, while simultaneously promoting the sustainable development of local communities in semi-arid regions. ""In terms of public policy, it is important to develop ways to bring water to the region, even considering carbon sequestration,"" says Newton La Scala Jr. The data obtained, the scientists argue, pave the way for new investigations into the mechanisms of carbon sequestration in semi-arid environments and their response to climate change. ""The continuity and improvement of monitoring, with integration between different systems, will be essential to refine estimates and guide effective mitigation actions,"" the study authors argue.",https://jornal.unesp.br/2025/07/28/estudo-revela-importancia-da-caatinga-para-o-sequestro-do-carbono-no-contexto-brasileiro/
KHM,"Climate TRACE data are used to show that road transport emissions in Cambodia exceed those from airports, reframing vehicles as the dominant contributor to national transport emissions. The article links this to EV ambitions and workforce development needs, without describing concrete follow‑on regulatory actions.",Cambodia’s EV success hinges on training and skills development,Khmer Times,"July 10, 2025","The Cambodian government has set ambitious 2030 targets that will see 800,000 electric vehicles (EVs)—cars, motorcycles and tuk tuk on Cambodia’s roads. This will help clean up Cambodia’s air, contribute to the fight against global heating and reduce the country’s reliance on imported oil; and as a new EnergyLab study shows, it will also create thousands of new jobs and skills across the Kingdom. To meet Cambodia’s goals, many more EV options must be available to meet the different economic, design and practical requirements that are currently met by petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles. These new cars and motorbikes must be enticing enough. Can an electric bike ever be cool enough to replace the loud and flashy bikes currently favoured by the Kingdom’s teenagers? Rugged enough to handle rural roads in the rainy season? Efficient enough to travel the country without fear of being unable to recharge? What makes a bike attractive to female students or retired aunties? International experience suggests that this is certainly possible. Almost one in five cars sold in 2023 was electric, with the global EV stock reaching 40 million vehicles. In China, 30 percent of motorbikes sold in 2023 were also electric. But as of November 2024, Cambodia only had 6,540 registered EVs; it’s clear that the task of getting almost 800,000 new vehicles on the road is real. This is important because according to Climate TRACE, vehicles on Cambodia’s roads contributed two million tonnes of Co2e in 2024, which is four times more than the country’s airports. It is clear that EVs running on clean energy will have a positive impact. Achieving Cambodia’s EV goal will also require many new technical and service workers, with staff needing to be trained across the country. There are currently about 150 local technicians with any EV training in Cambodia, and EnergyLab’s report shows this will need to grow significantly, to at least 15,000 EV assembly workers, engineers, technicians, service advisers and battery specialists required. Government projections on EV-related jobs are even higher. This offers great potential for developing new skills and well-paying jobs, and EnergyLab’s report highlights the many opportunities that exist to support the nationwide technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system. By adding EV repair and maintenance skills to the nation’s many technicians’ extraordinary ability to keep cars and bikes of all ages and conditions running, more people will be confident in buying an EV. Additional skills also need to be developed to support the increase in EVs. Most notably, the development of a broad network of charging stations, ideally utilising solar power to further incentivise the uptake of EVs by lowering operating costs. Indeed, the lack of charging infrastructure remains a major barrier to overcome; Vietnam has over 150,000 charging stations, while Cambodia has fewer than 100 public options. Recent government guidelines on charging stations are an important step, and as more stations are built they will need well-trained local staff who can ensure that chargers are running whenever needed, across the entire country. Households can now install up to 10kw home solar systems and this is more than enough for cars and bikes to be charged during the day for free, or at any convenient time if coupled with battery storage. And with the ability of a solar and battery to remove petrol costs, the running costs of an electric car become even more attractive. With suitable financing support to help with the initial installation costs, Cambodians across the country can feel more confident that adopting a more electric lifestyle will not be a financial burden. With such ambitious EV adoption targets, the government is clearly signalling that the future of road travel in Cambodia will be electric; and 2030 is very close indeed. All of these new vehicles will drive demand for new skills, the updating of existing ones, and it will be key that the Kingdom’s TVET schools can offer the necessary classes. A future with more EVs being driven along more rural roads across Cambodia, supported by a network of solar-charging stations, is certainly exciting. But this will only be possible with a large number of high-skilled mechanics, charging station technicians, vehicle assembly engineers and all of the other ancillary jobs.",https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501714696/cambodias-ev-success-hinges-on-training-and-skills-development/

The reporting emphasizes visibility of pollution plumes from multiple emitting sources around Athens on representative days, without describing follow‑on policy or enforcement actions.",Climate TRACE: The organization that records greenhouse gas emissions worldwide – Data for Greece,Newsbeast,"October 8, 2025","A few weeks ago, experts issued a new warning about the critical state our planet is in. Seven of the nine “planetary boundaries” have been crossed , they said, and they urged governments to listen to science. One of these long-overdue planetary limits is the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is largely due to the continued use of fossil fuels. However, in order for scientists to set realistic reduction targets and to be able to clearly monitor progress towards achieving them, it is necessary to collect and analyze reliable data regarding the sources of origin and the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by each region of the planet. In this field, the Climate TRACE (Climate Tracking Real-time Atmospheric Carbon Emissions) organization stands out as one of the most innovative tools worldwide. What is Climate TRACE? Climate TRACE is an international collaboration of scientists, technology providers and organizations, created with the aim of providing an independent and accurate mapping of greenhouse gas emissions across the planet. Using over 300 satellites, 11,000 sensors and numerous other data sources, and leveraging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, the platform maps greenhouse gas emissions at the country, industry and even individual facility level. The result is an unprecedented digital archive, which by 2024 will include more than 660 million facilities/emission sources around the world – from power plants and industrial plants to ports and airports. On the organization's interactive map , the user can find data by region, industry and gas type (CO₂, methane, etc.) for the year they are interested in. In addition, they can monitor the GWP (Global Warming Potential) index over a 20 or 100 year time horizon. What's happening in Greece? For 2025 up to July, carbon dioxide emissions in Greece reached 44.57 million tons, of which: 46.93% came from transport, communications and road traffic 21.41% from electricity generation units 10.9% from industry 9.81% from residential properties 8.3% from fossil fuel processing 2.43% from the agricultural sector 0.22% from mineral extraction Why it matters Climate TRACE's contribution is particularly important, as it offers for the first time an independent, global and transparent record of greenhouse gas emissions, without time delays. This gives governments, scientists and citizens the ability to know who is polluting, where and how much. In Greece, the climate law 4936/2022 provides: 55% reduction in emissions by 2030 (compared to 1990) Climate neutrality by 2050 It is worth noting that in 2023, Greece accounted for 2.3% of EU net greenhouse gas emissions and achieved a net emission reduction of 48.5% from 2005 to 2023, a percentage higher than the EU average reduction of 30.5% over the same period.",https://www.newsbeast.gr/environment/arthro/12606417/climate-trace-o-organismos-pou-katagrafei-tis-ekpobes-aerion-tou-thermokipiou-pagkosmios-ta-stoicheia-gia-tin-ellada

The reporting emphasizes visibility of pollution plumes from multiple emitting sources around Athens on representative days, without describing follow‑on policy or enforcement actions.","New Climate TRACE Tool Maps Air Pollution Plumes Over Athens and 2,500 Cities Worldwide",Tovima,"September 24, 2025","A new online tool launched by Climate TRACE reveals, in unprecedented detail, how industrial facilities and power plants worldwide expose billions of people to dangerous air pollution. The tool, released at Climate Week NYC, uses atmospheric modeling to make visible the plumes of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) — a deadly pollutant linked to nearly nine million deaths annually. According to Climate TRACE, 1.6 billion people across more than 2,500 urban areas are breathing in pollution from facilities that are also major contributors to the climate crisis. For the first time, the public can see how emissions from specific sources — including power plants, refineries, mines, shipping ports, and heavy manufacturing sites — disperse into surrounding neighborhoods over a 24-hour period. The data is drawn from Climate TRACE’s global database of more than 660 million greenhouse gas emission sources and modeled by Carnegie Mellon University’s CREATE Lab. The project identifies “super emitters,” facilities ranked among the top 10% of PM2.5 polluters worldwide. These sources account for a disproportionate share of pollution exposure: of the 1.6 billion people living in plumes, 900 million are affected by super emitters. Greece is among the countries with several cities now mapped. The tool shows plumes from 20 emitting sources around the capital of Athens on July 3, 2024, a day representing prevailing conditions. Ten of those facilities are classified as super emitters, underscoring the high risk of exposure for residents of one of Europe’s most densely populated capitals. Viewers can also look at plumes in Thessaloniki, Patras, Chalkida, Chania, Heraklion, and Volos. “Facilities that burn fossil fuels are the overwhelmingly dominant source of heat-trapping pollution that is driving the climate crisis — by using the sky as if it were an open sewer,” said Climate TRACE co-founder and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore in a press release by Climate TRACE. “The particulate air pollution they also create falls downwind into surrounding neighborhoods and is causing the deaths of 8.7 million people per year.” Globally, the cities with the largest exposed populations include Karachi, Guangzhou, Seoul, New York, and Dhaka. Together, the top 10 urban areas account for more than 162 million people living under harmful plumes. The coalition behind Climate TRACE brings together AI specialists, researchers, and NGOs, with support from organizations such as Carnegie Mellon’s CREATE Lab, Johns Hopkins University, Duke University, RMI, WattTime, TransitionZero, Global Fishing Watch, and former Vice President Gore himself. Climate TRACE says it tracks nearly all sources of human-caused PM2.5 pollution, but has only visualized the flow of that pollution for power plants, heavy manufacturing sites, ports, refineries, and mines in the 2,572 urban areas where they exist. It adds that it is “important to note that the tool does not represent all sources of PM2.5 in these urban areas. There are many other sources of this type of air pollution — from fires, to dust, and more — that are common, particularly in cities around the world.” The tool is designed for policymakers, journalists, researchers, and communities to identify hotspots and push for action, says Climate TRACE. While the current version focuses on stationary industrial sources, future updates plan to expand coverage to other major contributors, including transport and residential fuel use.

IND,"Climate TRACE and satellite‑linked estimates are used to highlight under‑counted methane emissions from large landfills including Ghazipur, Bhalswa, and Okhla in Delhi, as well as Jawaharnagar in Hyderabad and Dhapa in Kolkata. The data are used to show gaps between official inventories and facility‑level estimates. Follow‑on actions described include Indore’s use of the Gobardhan scheme to operate a Bio‑CNG plant from municipal waste.",Are methane emissions in India being missed?,The Hindu,"December 16, 2025","What fuels landfill fires and is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period? The answer is methane. While it is an excellent fuel for kitchen stoves, CNG vehicles, and power plants, it is also busy burning the planet. Methane is generated naturally by decomposing organic matter. The same prehistoric processes that created natural gas reserves are now at work within landfills. Managing methane means not just cleaner cities but also a significant step toward our climate ambitions. 
Around 15% of India's methane emissions are from the waste sector. Unlike theagriculture or energy sectors, which require complex, long-term reforms, waste management offers immediate gains through targeted action. Crucially, the policy frameworks and incentives are already in place through national programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Mission. 
Targeted action is only possible if we know exactly where the hotspots are, but tracking an invisible gas is difficult. Historically, we have relied on models that estimate emissions by tracking incoming waste volumes and applying baseline assumptions. However, this approach depends on accurate, recurring data, which is often scarce in developing countries. Because such data are aggregated at theregional or national levels and updated infrequently, it makes pinpointing individual sources nearly impossible. 
The alternative is physical monitoring, which is even more challenging in the Indian context. Ground-level detection requires expensive equipment, regular maintenance, and constant oversight, making it logistically and technically difficult to scale. 
As technology advances, satellites are stepping into this gap. This data broadly fall into two categories: regional measurements that monitor methane over a few kilometers (frequent and useful for national trends), and fine-resolution detection that can pinpoint hotspots down to a few square meters (critical for targeted action). 
India has already taken the first steps toward this opportunity. Last year, a paper published by scientists from ISRO quantified anthropogenic methane emissions across the country using satellite data that was acquired in 2023. Based on these measurements, the study identified major dumpsites in Pirana (Ahmedabad), Deonar and Kanjurmarg (Mumbai), and a sewage outlet as significant emitters. The National Green Tribunal took these findings further, establishing a committee to conduct ground investigations at the flagged sites. 
Over the past few years, multiple new satellite missions have emerged, such as CarbonMapper's Tanager and the Space Research Organisation Netherlands (SRON) projects. These satellites provide public data covering major landfills across thecountry, including Ghazipur and Okhla in Delhi, Jawaharnagar in Hyderabad, and Dhapa in Kolkata. Platforms such as ClimateTRACE and WasteMap collate this global monitoring data, combining it with baseline statistics for advanced modeling. These newer models refine traditional calculations by integrating real-time satellite observations and updating landfill-specific estimates to reflect reality. 
Globally, satellite surveys estimate that actual landfill emissions can exceed model-based predictions by around 1.8 times. In India, city-level comparisons are difficult due to a lack of granular data on waste characteristics. Consequently, we must rely on State-level estimates from 2018 for sector-wise breakdowns, as newer public data have not yet been compiled. This discrepancy between advanced satellite observations and older State models highlights a critical information gap: we currently cannot agree on the true scale of the numbers or the location of thehotspots. 
Take Delhi as an example: its 2018 emissions inventory estimates 1.07 million tons of CO2 equivalent annually from the entire solid waste sector. Recent satellite observations, however, estimate emissions from just Ghazipur and Bhalswa alone to be between 0.85 and 0.96 million tons — almost as much as the sector's entire theoretical footprint. In Mumbai, the data offer a different perspective. While calculations suggest that the Kanjurmarg landfill accounts for 11% of the city's waste emissions, an expected number given its engineered design. However, satellite data show it to be emitting 1.05 million tons. This is almost 10 times the model's estimate and approximately half of the entire State's solid waste emissions. A similar discrepancy emerges in Gujarat: the state estimates 0.73 million tons for the entire sector, satellite observations show the landfills in Surat and Ahmedabad alone emitting between 0.60 and 0.81 million tons. 
These are not just numbers. They indicate potential leakages, accelerated methane generation, or opportunities to refine our engineered systems.. Critically, these are hazards we never tackled simply because we did not know they existed. Now, we can not only gauge the magnitude of the problem but, in the case of large landfills, also pinpoint the exact source of the leaks, allowing for precise, targeted solutions. 
Of course, these observations come with limitations. Cloud interference and complex weather dynamics mean that satellite data cannot fulfil its potential in isolation. Urban local bodies must complement these findings with ground-level insights, a step that is especially critical for the massive, unwieldy landfills of our metro cities. The real breakthrough lies in linking satellite detection with ground-level action. 
When satellites detect a methane hotspot, ground teams can immediately investigate the cause — whether it is poor waste coverage, a gas collection failure, or illegal dumping. This creates a powerful feedback loop: space-based detection guides targeted ground interventions, while ground data validate and improve satellite accuracy. Integrating other data sources beyond just methane monitoring can further enhance the efficiency of this loop. 
At open dumpsites such as Ghazipur, recording dumping and reclamation patterns provides critical insight into how human activity drives methane generation. Meanwhile, at engineered landfills such as Jawaharnagar and Kanjurmarg, infrastructure data on existing gas collection systems can help pinpoint leaks and identify hidden hotspots. Cities such as Bengaluru, with their advanced waste management systems, are well-positioned to integrate these datasets to increase transparency. 
To address this, we need coordinated action on three critical fronts: expanding satellite monitoring to cover all major waste sites, establishing on-ground validation systems in metro cities, and creating standardised data-sharing protocols between urban local bodies and oversight agencies. 
Currently, urban local bodies operate in silos, separate from the State Pollution Control Boards that oversee them. This disconnect hinders coordinated action on methane reduction. However, the revised municipal waste guidelines already envision a centralised data portal for bulk waste management, handling the wet waste that is the primary source of untreated methane. This portal could be expanded to connect with a standardised nationwide dataset for tracking emissions. Regional bodies such as the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the NCR can oversee this monitoring, while the Swachh Bharat Mission can integrate methane targets, aligning them with other central schemes. 
This integrated approach delivers multiple co-benefits that make the investment worthwhile. Methane's potential as a fuel is already recognised in policy. Just recently, Indore has utilised the Gobardhan scheme to set up a Bio-CNG plant from its waste. 
This strategy creates a powerful ecosystem: satellites detect hotspots, ground teams investigate and fix leaks, and standardised data sharing ensures insights reach decision-makers instantly. What is needed now is coordinated implementation across these three fronts. By making data the backbone of our waste policy, we can turn one of our biggest environmental challenges into our smartest climate solution.",https://www.thehindu.com/data/are-methane-emissions-in-india-being-missed/article70399086.ece

But overall, India's emissions increased by 0.21% , resulting in an additional 4.44 million tonnes of CO₂e . Major US share The US alone increased emissions by 48.57 million tonnes of CO₂e— an increase of 1.43% , accounting for the largest share of the global increase. This shows that America is still highly dependent on oil, gas and coal. Other sources of emissions growth Emissions from fossil fuel operations increased by 1.5% (77.65 million tonnes CO₂e). Emissions from the industry/construction sector increased by 0.3% (18.75 million tonnes), mainly from India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Brazil.

IRL,"Climate TRACE data are used to identify Mannok’s cement factory in Ballyconnell, County Cavan as one of Ireland’s largest single sources of greenhouse gas emissions, ranking it as the country’s eighth biggest emitter with nearly 650,000 tonnes of CO₂ in 2024. The reporting uses the dataset to translate national emissions into facility-level accountability, comparing the plant’s output to the electricity emissions of nearly one million homes. In response, Cavan County Council’s Climate Action Plan references Mannok’s proposed “renewable energy valley,” including on-site renewable power and green hydrogen production, as part of a planned decarbonisation pathway, and states that these efforts were considered in local climate planning.",Revealed: The Irish factory with emissions so high that Al Gore put it on his naughty list,The Irish Independent,"January 29, 2026","Mannok’s Co Cavan cement factory generates so much greenhouse gas that it is listed as Ireland’s eighth biggest emitter on Al Gore’s Climate Trace website.

The independent tracker attributed nearly 650,000 tonnes of C02 to the Ballyconnell facility in 2024 – equivalent to the electricity emissions from almost one million homes.

But, according to Cavan County Council’s first Climate Action Plan, Mannok plans to decarbonise cement production and power its facilities by building a “renewable energy valley”, including local green hydrogen production.

The company, formerly part of Seán Quinn’s empire, would not offer a spokesperson when asked for an interview about its plans, but a spokesperson for Cavan County Council said it has a “strong working relationship with Mannok and has met with and been kept briefed with regard to Mannok’s decarbonisation plans”.

“The local authority has taken account of these efforts in its Climate Action Plan,” they added.

According to the action plan: “The removal of close to half-a-million tonnes of CO2 per annum will not only have a substantial impact on the county’s emissions reduction requirements, but will also provide for vast co-benefits in the areas of employment, air quality, clean energy and economic prosperity.”

While they appear to be working to cut energy and production emissions, Mannok and the council have come under fire over a quarry application that could destroy another vital tool in the fight against climate change: Aughaweenagh Fartrin bog.

The Irish Peatland Restoration Council says raised bogs are a “unique feature of the Irish landscape” and “an important store of carbon, helping to control greenhouse gases”.

West Cavan Bogs Association’s Paddy Gilroy, a Save Ballyheady supporter, said “Cavan County Council leant over backwards to accommodate Mannok in its planning application for the quarry”.

“We made 100 submissions against this quarry,” he said. “It was completely going to obliterate our raised bogs, which are very precious.

“There’s two bogs in Cavan up to this level: Kilconny Bog in east Cavan and our bog, Aughaweenagh Fartrin bog.

“If you have a good active bog with active stagnant moss, carbon will be stored indefinitely.""

Have they given up on the planning application or have they not?

Submissions to the council about the quarry application outlined concerns about the impact it could have on the protected Lough Oughter, as well as on Upper and Lower Lough Erne.

An Taisce and other groups raised the issue of Aughaweenagh Fartrin bog, which is northeast of the site and could be damaged if the quarry, itself proposed on peatland, was allowed to go ahead.

While the planning application was withdrawn, resubmitted and then withdrawn again, locals are concerned Mannok will “probably pursue it again”.

“There's always ongoing debate here among the locals,” Mr Gilroy said. “‘Have they given up on the planning application or have they not?’”

In the meantime, volunteers have been working to restore the bog, having won funding from the local Credit Union.

Mr Gilroy added: “Leader [an EU funding programme] are very keen to give us funding for this project, so it would make no sense for Cavan County Council to grant the application for a quarry immediately adjacent to it.”

Mannok did not respond to requests for a comment. A council spokesperson said: “It is not appropriate for Cavan County Council to comment on individual cases.”",https://www.independent.ie/regionals/cavan/news/revealed-the-irish-factory-with-emissions-so-high-that-al-gore-put-it-on-his-naughty-list/a593637927.html

Shymkent Mayor Gabit Syzdykbekov commented on the widespread complaints from residents about deteriorating air quality at a press conference at the Central Communications Service. He stated that there is no health threat, but confirmed that pollution issues are indeed being reported. Details Journalists have noted that residents' complaints continue unabated: people write about the persistent smell of burning and gas, and post photos on social media of themselves walking around the city wearing respirators—otherwise, breathing is simply difficult. ""Meanwhile, local environmentalists insist there are no exceedances in the city. But if you look at international data, specifically Climate Trace, the Shymkent Oil Refinery, Shymkentcement, and Standard Cement are among the companies that emit more particulate matter than over 90% of industrial facilities worldwide. Why do the figures from government environmental agencies differ so widely?"" the journalist asked. Gabit Syzdykbekov acknowledged that there are periods in the city when air quality ""leaves much to be desired."" He attributed this to several factors, primarily the operation of industrial enterprises. ""We conduct regular inspections and negotiate with businesses to ensure they use the most modern air purification filters. Secondly, the heating season has an impact. Many residents don't use gas. Even heating a sauna affects air quality. Windless weather also has an impact, especially during the heating season,"" the mayor explained. Checks and security Gabit Syzdykbekov noted that the Akimat conducts regular inspections and is in constant contact with environmental activists. Environmentalists conduct inspections of businesses and other facilities. ""Based on the results of 10 months, if I'm not mistaken, there have already been about 30 inspections. Fines have been imposed somewhere around 40 million. The work is ongoing,"" the akim reported. When asked why data from local environmental services differs from international ones, Gabit Syzdykbekov responded that he trusts local environmentalists more, as he doesn't know whether international experts actually come to Shymkent to test air quality. ""Our city is relatively safe, but I repeat: the primary influence is the heating season and industry, which we fine and force to constantly use special filters,"" the mayor noted. Context At the end of November, residents of Shymkent complained en masse about deteriorating air quality, with smog and severe air pollution present throughout the city. BES.media sent a request to the Akimat to determine the causes of the pollution and the measures planned. A response was received from the Shymkent Department of Ecology, part of the Committee for Environmental Regulation and Control of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. The department confirmed that elevated air pollution levels were recorded in the city from November 18 to 26. The department clarified that air quality in Shymkent is monitored at seven permanent stations. At four of them (PNZ Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 8), samples are collected manually, while at three more (PNZ Nos. 5, 6, and the station in Kyzylsay), data is collected automatically. According to daily air quality reports, hydrogen sulfide levels exceeded the permissible limits in November. The department's testing laboratory also detected elevated concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, but they remain within acceptable limits. WAS ANYONE PUNISHED? The Department of Ecology reported that 29 scheduled and unscheduled inspections were conducted in the first 10 months of 2025. As a result, 50 administrative cases were initiated, and fines imposed totaled approximately 37.6 million tenge, of which 32.6 million tenge were recovered. Nineteen natural resource users were inspected in Shymkent's industrial zones. By court order, the operations of five companies were temporarily suspended: Hill LLC, Hermes BE LLC, Kategoriya DM LLC, Khabibulla Individual Entrepreneur, and Muhammad Individual Entrepreneur. WHERE TO MONITOR THE AIR CONDITIONS To know how safe the air is to breathe, citizens must have constant access to air quality data. Therefore, journalists asked for clarification on where such data is published. The department reported that the Ministry of Ecology has developed an automated information system for collecting, organizing, storing, processing, and disseminating environmental information. Citizens can monitor this information on the website . In addition, information on the results of measurements conducted by the department is regularly published on the department's electronic digital information pages on Facebook and Instagram. Environmental monitoring data is also available on the Kazhydromet website . Furthermore, the Air.kz mobile app provides real-time information on Shymkent's pollution by displaying actual pollutant concentrations from observation posts located throughout the city, the department said. WHAT'S LIKE IN OTHER CITIES In Atyrau, the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with local authorities, will conduct a study of the environmental situation and its impact on the health of residents in the region. The results of the analysis will determine whether local residents will receive compensation and benefits. Residents of Astana faced the effects of heavy smog on December 2: according to environmentalists, air quality in the capital deteriorated sharply and exceeded acceptable levels. At 6 a.m., the AQI (Air Quality Index) reached 131, a critical pollution level. Furthermore, a study by the Almaty Air Initiative found that one in four Almaty residents is already considering moving, and 80% report deteriorating health due to smog.

The situation only worsened in the fall and winter: according to a study by the Almaty Air Initiative, the proportion of those dissatisfied with air quality increased from 42% in 2024 to 50% in 2025, and 63% of residents directly say smog bothers them. Against this backdrop, December in Almaty is marked by dense haze, dark rain, and widespread complaints from residents. SHYNDYK.KZ investigated the reasons for this and what the authorities and environmentalists are saying. Bad air Over the past three years, air pollution in Almaty has ceased to be a ""winter anomaly"" and has become a constant. According to the Almaty Air Initiative, in 2024, the average annual PM2.5 concentration was approximately 20–21 μg/m³, approximately four times higher than the WHO recommendation (5 μg/m³). This year, the metropolis remains the most polluted major city in Kazakhstan and is among the 25 most polluted cities in the world, according to international rankings. According to a new AAI study, 50% of city residents consider the air quality in the city to be poor, 63% say smog bothers them very much or very much, and every second Almaty resident has at least once considered moving abroad for the winter due to air quality. Geography and climate only exacerbate the effect: the city is located in a basin at the foot of the mountains, and temperature inversions are common in winter, trapping cold air in the air. On windless days, smog literally hangs over Almaty, turning it into a gray roof. This morning, the Regional Communications Service reported that air quality in Almaty has noticeably improved: after rain and snow, the sky over the city has cleared, and the mountains are much more visible. Precipitation and wind have cleared the atmosphere, reducing smog levels. Kazhydromet is predicting snowfall and frost, which should further reduce pollutant concentrations. According to estimates, intense precipitation can reduce PM2.5 levels by up to 80% in just a few hours. Dynamics of deterioration By 2025, Almaty had repeatedly topped global air pollution rankings. On January 14, 2025, the AQI+ index reached 256, ranking it ""very unhealthy."" In the fall of 2025, IQAir recorded average PM2.5 concentrations in the city at approximately four times the WHO annual benchmark. December only continued this trend. According to the AQICN station at the US Embassy, ​​air quality was classified as ""unhealthy"" during some nighttime hours at the beginning of the month. And according to IQAir, during the day on December 9, the AQI in Almaty was ""moderate,"" but PM2.5 concentrations remained approximately 4-5 times higher than WHO recommendations. Dirty rain One of the main topics of December was the phenomenon of ""dirty rain."" Residents noticed that precipitation left dark stains and streaks on light-colored clothing and cars. This photo was posted on social media by user Ainur Argancheeva. A video model published by Climate Trace provides additional context, showing how pollution from Almaty's thermal power plants moves throughout the city over the course of a day. Smog from the plants spreads across residential areas, confirming what residents have long seen with the naked eye. On December 1, Almaty's local authorities introduced new environmental regulations to reduce air pollution and upgrade the vehicle fleet. Separate regulations for air quality protection are being developed and are currently undergoing approval. At the same time, oversight of cafes and kebab houses using solid fuels has been strengthened: 12 establishments were inspected in the first days of December, with violations found at 10 of them. Fireworks display cancelled Amid persistent smog, Almaty residents are increasingly calling on social media to avoid setting off fireworks on New Year's. Users are posting images of dense, foggy pollution, complaining of poor health and a sharp reduction in visibility on the roads. Residents fear that fireworks displays on New Year's Eve could further increase the burden on already polluted air. Furthermore, users are reminded of the risks to people and animals: fireworks annually cause injuries, and emergency services are on high alert during the holidays. Videos are appearing online where people describe how smog aggravates their colds and flu, as well as shortness of breath and coughing. Some videos and stories show the city literally engulfed in a gray haze on windless evenings. A common theme in the comments is: ""Every breath feels like a cigarette."" This is how a new urban reality is taking shape: people aren't just complaining, but demanding concrete action from authorities and businesses. What the Ministry of Ecology says Amid complaints from residents about dark stains after rain, the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of the Republic of Kazakhstan has officially clarified the cause of this phenomenon. ""In recent weeks, Almaty has experienced a prolonged lack of precipitation, resulting in increased levels of pollutants—dust, soot, and emissions from vehicles and industrial plants—accumulating in the atmosphere. The situation was exacerbated by calm weather and a temperature inversion, which contributed to the accumulation of pollutants in the ground-level atmosphere,"" the department explained. The ministry emphasized that the first rain after a prolonged dry period acted as a natural air purifier. ""Yesterday's rain was the first after a prolonged dry period and, as the so-called 'first cleansing rain,' washed a significant amount of these particles from the air. During precipitation, raindrops capture dust and soot in the atmosphere and transfer them to the ground. Therefore, dark marks may be visible on light-colored clothing, windows, or car bodies—this is a normal physical phenomenon,"" the Ministry of Ecology said in its official response. This phenomenon is known scientifically as ""dirty rain"" or ""sooty rain."" It doesn't mean the rain is toxic, but it does indicate a high concentration of pollutants in the air, particularly fine particles PM2.5 and PM10. The agency clarified that the rain itself is not hazardous. ""Rain does wash pollutants out of the atmosphere—this is a scientifically proven process called 'wet deposition.' Dark spots form due to settled particles of dust, soot, and vehicle emissions caught in raindrops. If the rain were chemically hazardous or acidic, characteristic signs would be observed—odor, metal corrosion, scorched leaves, etc. In this case, none of this was observed,"" the Ministry of Ecology noted. The ministry's final explanation for the stains is clear: ""The appearance of dark stains on clothing is the result of accumulated dust and soot particles being washed out of the atmosphere by the first rain."" The agency emphasizes that ""this is a natural phenomenon, but it serves as an indicator of elevated air pollution levels in Almaty."" Main sources of pollution It's no coincidence that Almaty has once again been blanketed in smog. Experts believe there are several reasons for this. As is well known, the city itself is located in a basin at the foot of the Trans-Ili Alatau, and temperature inversions are common—when cold air ""covers"" warm air, preventing pollution from rising. And when the wind is calm and there's no precipitation, harmful substances accumulate in the ground layer, forming persistent smog. In the winter of 2025, these conditions were almost ideal for smog: the heating season, light winds, temperature fluctuations, and rare precipitation. Environmentalists have been repeating for years that Almaty's smog has several key sources: the thermal power plant, the flow of vehicles, and private and small-scale heating using coal and wood. According to ecologist Abay Erekenov, the key source of persistent smog in Almaty remains the thermal power industry, primarily coal-fired power plants. He emphasized that even with filters, emissions from the plants are literally ""locked"" over the city during winter inversions and are greatly amplified by light winds and the terrain. Environmentalist Azamatkhan Amirtayev , chairman of the green political party ""Baytak,"" previously explained that Almaty's problem isn't limited to the burning of coal and solid fuels in the private sector and at energy facilities; vehicle exhaust contributes the lion's share to air quality. But it's the energy and heating industries that create constant ""background"" emissions, which are then compounded by vehicle exhaust, industrial sources, and smoke from cafes and private boilers. As a result, the city is effectively blanketed in polluted air in winter, and without systematic modernization of thermal power plants, a transition to cleaner technologies, and a review of the entire heating infrastructure, the smog problem, experts say, cannot be solved. Advice to residents While the city and government are seeking systemic solutions, residents are forced to protect themselves. For example, they should monitor real-time air quality measurements using apps like IQAir and AQICN. These apps display current AQI values ​​and concentrations of PM2.5, NO₂, and other pollutants in Almaty and its suburbs. The website AirKaz.org offers an online pollution map by station across the city. On polluted days, if possible, limit long walks and outdoor exercise, wear FFP2/N95 masks, and use air purifiers or at least wet cleaning. It's worth noting that city residents themselves can influence sources of air pollution. Some can give up old cars and unnecessary trips, using public transportation instead. The private sector, where possible, can switch to cleaner fuels and upgrade stoves and chimneys. And avoid fireworks displays on New Year's. Overall, city residents have been voting with concern for a long time. Today's smog in Almaty is no longer a seasonal problem—it's become part of the city's reality. December demonstrated once again that a single rainstorm can clear the air for only hours or days, but doesn't address the underlying cause. Without modernization of the energy sector, a transition to clean fuels, genuine transport reform, and strict environmental controls, the city will return to the same question every year: what are we breathing? Residents are expecting systemic solutions from the authorities, because the health and future of the city are at stake.",https://shyndyk.kz/news/eksperty-i-vlasti-prokommentirovali-zhaloby-almaatintsev-na-plohoe-kachestvo-vozduha-i-gryaznyj-dozhd/

He added that “the more orange circles there are, the higher the pollution in the ground layer where we breathe.” Reference PM – particulate matter – solid suspended particles or fine dust. PM2.5 – particles up to 2.5 micrometers in diameter, which easily penetrate deep into the lungs and are considered particularly harmful to health. what was before In October of this year, the Almaty Akimat developed an air quality project with the goal of systematically reducing pollution levels in the metropolis. However, city authorities did not include the thermal power plant (TPP) on the list of major air polluters. According to Renaissance Plus, up to 60% of all emissions in the city come from motor vehicles. The remainder comes from private residential activity and stationary sources of pollution, such as industrial plants, saunas, barbecue joints, catering facilities, and construction. Research results In August of this year, the Central Asia Climate Foundation reported that Almaty's air quality has remained severely polluted for nine of the past 10 years. Only in 2017 were pollution levels slightly lower. As a result, more than 2.3 million city residents regularly breathe air containing harmful substances that exceed safe limits. According to the foundation, the city's geographic location was initially unfavorable for natural air exchange, and widespread, haphazard development over the past 20 years has worsened the situation to the point that the city is shrouded in a thick blanket of smog for more than six months. Context BES.media previously conducted a thorough study of this issue, the results of which were published in a special project. The article raises the question of why Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, has remained in an ecological trap for over a decade. Almaty residents complain of headaches, allergies, and constant colds—all because of the air they breathe. Almaty consistently tops the list of the most polluted cities in Kazakhstan. Many Astana residents also suffer from allergies: 28% of adults in Astana suffer from allergic rhinitis, and 20% of children have inflammatory skin diseases. Over the past three years, the number of adults suffering from bronchial asthma in the city has increased by 37%.",https://bes.media/news/ekoaktivist-pokazal-kak-smog-ot-tets-ov-rasseivaetsya-po-almati-ca9471/

This is a worrying sign: the city, which has struggled with smog and air pollution for years, is once again at the forefront of environmental concerns. A Baq.kz correspondent explored the reasons, experts' opinions, and how the authorities plan to improve the situation. Why was CHPP-2 blacklisted? Experts from the Almaty Air Initiative Foundation have concluded that CHPP-2 is among the world's largest sources of PM₂.₅ emissions. In 2024, tens of tons of these particles were recorded from the CHPP: approximately 94 tons of these microparticles in that year alone. The problem is that CHPP-2 and CHPP-3 use high-ash coal, which exacerbates the problem: the combustion process produces large quantities of fine dust and toxic compounds. According to IQAir, Almaty ranks second among cities in the world for air pollution (as of certain dates), with a high AQI and exceedances of maximum allowable levels. The coal used at combined heat and power plants (CHPs) contains many impurities and high ash content. Combustion produces extremely fine particles that are difficult to filter. Furthermore, many cleaning, filtration, and ash and dust collection systems are technically outdated or ineffective. CHPs lack state-of-the-art filters, electrostatic precipitators, and gas scrubbing systems. ""We've been warning for a long time: unless the treatment systems at the combined heat and power plant are upgraded, the problem won't go away. Being included in global rankings is a wake-up call. We need a plan to upgrade the combined heat and power plant, convert it to gas-fired cogeneration, and completely phase out coal. Ekibastuz coal is a major polluter,"" says environmentalist and public figure Abai Erekenov. The graph shows that PM₂.₅ levels increase during the winter season, peaking in 2024–2025. Interestingly, the main contributors to the city's pollution are TPP-2, which accounts for about 40%, private homes that burn coal and wood also contribute 30%, transport 20%, and industrial facilities 10%. In terms of air emissions, Almaty's Thermal Power Plant-2 is second only to the largest coal-fired power plants in India and China. However, when comparing this single Kazakh city with densely populated megacities around the world, it becomes clear that effective air pollution control measures have not been implemented in Almaty. There are several other reasons why Almaty's air pollution is becoming more severe. First, the city's location in a mountain basin creates conditions for stagnant air: in winter, the air is cold, there's no wind, and temperature inversions trap pollution in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Second, until recently, there were insufficient measuring stations and automated posts. Furthermore, the system for notifying the public about deteriorating air quality was weak. How the authorities are dealing with the problem Last year, the city's Department of Ecology allocated 10 billion 771 million tenge for environmental improvements. These figures provide insight: CHPP-2 is not just a local polluter, but a globally significant source of emissions that impacts not only Almaty but also the regional environment. Expenditures on environmental programs increased from 3.1 billion tenge in 2018 to 10.7 billion tenge in 2024. At the thermal power plant, technology has begun to be updated: the Akimat has installed eight stationary and two mobile automated air monitoring stations. The city plans to upgrade its filtration systems, including electrostatic precipitators, wet and dry cleaning systems, desulfurization, and ash separation. It will gradually transition to less polluting fuels—gas or cleaner coal, where possible. Authorities have also launched a project to inform the public about air quality via LED screens. In Almaty, work is underway on all three sources of city pollution: the Combined Heat and Power Plant (CHP-2), the State District Power Plant (GRES), coal-fired boiler houses, and the foundry. Plans include reducing emissions, implementing ""green transport"" by increasing the number of electric and gas-powered buses, updating the public transport fleet, building new public transport lines, and restricting the entry of older vehicles without catalytic converters (LEZs) into Low Emission Zones (LEZs). In addition, so-called ""green belts"" and ""green islands"" will be created around the CHPP to prevent dust from spreading. Plants that accumulate metals, such as chestnut, juniper, and others, will be planted there. As for the private sector, the use of coal will be reduced, and stoves will be gradually replaced by gas, electricity, and central heating in areas where this is possible. The new microdistricts will be built taking into account the mountain-valley wind corridors of air circulation in order to minimize obstacles to air movement. Expert opinions and ways out of the crisis According to experts, the mistake in urban development policy is that authorities are returning to solutions that were proposed by experts 10–15 years ago. Ecologist Abai Erekenov points out that the idea of ​​modernizing Almaty's energy system is nothing new—the city has had existing design solutions for many years that would allow for a gradual phase-out of coal-fired capacity. He notes that even during the development of the city's master plan, the gradual replacement of outdated heat sources with modern cogeneration units—compact plants that simultaneously produce heat, hot water, and electricity with very high efficiency—was discussed. ""The latest General Plan proposed creating cogeneration units on the sites of all these boiler houses, combined heat and power plants, and power plants—something the authorities are currently doing only at CHPP-2, albeit on a smaller scale. Converting the CHPP to gas would free up land where coal and gold mines were stored. There are over a hundred such facilities throughout the city. They were included in the original version of the General Plan, and the idea was actually proposed by the document's designers themselves, but was later abandoned,"" says Erekenov. He explains that geothermal heating systems are heat pumps based on the principles of air conditioners and refrigerators, and details their efficiency and advantages over traditional boilers. ""A heat pump is an inverter air conditioner that captures heat from inside and expels it outside. In winter, it conversely draws heat from outside and pumps it into the home. These systems can have an efficiency ratio of up to 5:1—meaning they produce 5 kilowatts of heat for every kilowatt of electricity. This has long been common in Europe and the US,"" explains the ecologist. According to him, combined solutions could be implemented in Almaty: geothermal heating and solar power stations for shopping centers, office buildings, and large residential complexes. This would reduce the load on the city's energy system and completely eliminate emissions. However, according to him, key points of this program were excluded from the final version of the General Plan without the participation of experts and the public. The ecologist emphasizes that modernization should not be limited to just CHPP-2. ""Everything has been pinned down to CHPP-2, but we have hundreds of boiler houses. They're all listed in the city's General Plan. To clean the air, we need to gasify everything—not just burn gas like a kettle, but install cogeneration units. They're compact and energy-efficient—they produce more heat and electricity per thousand cubic meters of gas than conventional boiler houses. Tariffs will be lower, the air will be cleaner, and people won't complain. Moreover, all this can be accomplished in two to three years,"" the expert notes. The ecologist emphasizes that international partners are ready to assist Kazakhstan financially and technologically. The EBRD and European manufacturers are willing to finance heat pumps and cogeneration systems with low-interest loans, but the Akimat is not taking advantage of these opportunities. ""The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is financing cogeneration at CHPP-2, is ready to provide loans to private businesses and even individuals. The funds have been allocated, so I don't even have to look for them. If I own an office and want to switch to a heat pump or cogeneration, I can get a preferential loan. They are also ready to finance private homes. If I install a heat pump, I disconnect from the city grid, reducing the load on the city. And European manufacturers—Italians, Germans—are ready to provide export-import loans for the supply of equipment,"" the expert says. Other sources of pollution in the city Experts agree with the authorities: the combined heat and power plant remains the most visible ""tip of the iceberg,"" but there are other polluters as well. They believe these include not only thousands of private homes burning coal and wood, old cars, but also industry. Abai Erekenov provides a detailed classification of the main sources of air pollution in Almaty, based on their contribution levels. According to him, the main polluters are thermal power plants, district heating plants, and coal-fired boilers, followed by industry, including foundries within the city limits. ""They need to be moved outside the city limits, at least towards Kunayev. Next in line is Almaty International Airport. One Boeing aircraft burns as much kerosene per year as two hundred thousand cars. And yet, the airport plans to increase the number of aircraft departures by 200,000 per year. According to the General Plan, Almaty International Airport was supposed to be moved towards Kapchagay, but that idea was later abandoned because it would be too expensive for the Turks to build a new airport. Heavy transport is in fourth place – these are Chinese trucks and buses, which don't meet any environmental standards for emissions or noise. After a year of use, they fall apart and pollute the air around them. And yet, people continue to buy them. And in last place are old passenger cars. Modern Euro-4 or Euro-5 vehicles emit almost no pollutants if they use normal fuel,"" says the ecologist. The ecologist adds that the claims about ""developing public transport"" in the General Plan are not supported by actual research into Almaty's passenger traffic. He attributes the lack of infrastructure solutions to the same bureaucratic substitution mechanism: no research is available, and all genuine expert comments are ignored. ""The authorities say, 'Switch to public transportation.' But why isn't there a public transportation system in the General Plan? If you want people to switch, build a metro. A public transportation system assumes that you can get from any point in the city using three modes of public transportation. We don't have that. And this isn't just our opinion; international experts who conducted research here say the same thing. Our developers haven't conducted any research on traffic and passenger flows,"" the ecologist says. He emphasizes that the Almaty authorities had unique data at their disposal that could have served as the basis for sound urban planning and environmental reform. However, the results of professional research conducted by American experts were never used. ""The Akimat simply didn't use the research conducted by the Americans in Almaty over the course of two years. Even though these studies for 2016-2017 were given to the authorities for free. They included traffic flow and passenger flow. After all, they had professional equipment that counted not only cars and buses but also the number of passengers. They performed all the calculations,"" the ecologist notes. The inclusion of Almaty's Thermal Power Plant 2 among the world's top polluters is a wake-up call: the city is on the brink of an environmental crisis, and without serious measures—modernization, strict monitoring, and a transition to clean technologies—the situation will continue to worsen. If the mayor's office, environmentalists, and businesses find consensus, formulate a clear development plan, allocate funds, and implement it responsibly, Almaty could cease to be considered one of the ""dirtiest cities.""",https://rus.baq.kz/ugolnyy-sled-almaty-kak-tets-2-prevratila-gorod-v-tsentr-globalnogo-smoga_300025975/

Experts analyze what causes thick smog in the metropolis,Stan.kz,"October 28, 2025","The main sources of pollution in Almaty in winter are the coal-fired CHP-2 and CHP-3. According to international estimates, the actual emissions from these facilities may be much higher than the official figures. So it is not a myth that the residents of the metropolis inhale 70 cigarettes of smoke per month. Since when has the Thermal Power Plant in Almaty been operating on gas and will this change improve the air quality in the metropolis? In general, can the problem of thick smog in Almaty be solved? Stan.kz news agency checked with the Almaty akimat, as well as specialists from the fund fighting the problem of polluted air. Why is the conversion and modernization of CHP-2 to gas delayed? Let us recall that the issue of converting the thermal power plant in Almaty to gas was raised in 2020. The akimat said at the time that the plant would be modernized in 2025. Five years have passed, but the Almaty CHP-2 has not yet been converted to gas, and is still operating on coal. And eco-activists of the metropolis and experts concerned about the air problem name the thermal power plant as one of the factors polluting the air in Almaty. In this regard, the Stan.kz news agency sent a query to the Almaty akimat. Our query was answered by Almaty Power Stations JSC and the Department of Ecology and Environment. According to those responsible, the project ""Modernization of Thermal Power Plant-2 with minimal impact on the environment"" has been extended for 1 year. The project ""Modernization of Almaty CHP-2 with minimal environmental impact"" has been extended due to a significant change in the terms of delivery of the main equipment by SIEMENS ENERGY. That is, the completion date of the project has been extended by 1 year - until the end of 2026. In addition, on August 10, 2023, by order of the First Deputy Prime Minister R.V. Sklyar, a Roadmap with a responsibility matrix for the implementation of the project ""Modernization of Almaty CHP-2"" with minimal environmental impact was approved. According to the document, the term of the EPC contract is set at 39 months (June 2023 - September 2026),"" the response provided to us states. The center will not be renovated for 39 months According to the akimat, the center will not be renovated for 39 months. However, the project is expected to be completed and put into operation by the end of 2026. It is expected that the deadline will not be extended, and the project is planned to be implemented on time. ""When implementing the gasification project ""Almaty CHP-2 modernization"", efficient gas turbine units will be installed to reduce harmful emissions by 93%, from 37,100 tons to 2,700 tons, and this will be achieved through the use of natural gas. This meets the standards of the European Union and the requirements for the introduction of the best available technologies in Kazakhstan. Greenhouse gases (CO2) will be reduced by 38%, from 4,000 tons to 2,500 tons. In addition to reducing harmful emissions, no ash residue will be formed after gasification,"" the departments of the Almaty akimat assured. CHPP-2 is among the 10% of the world's largest polluters According to the Almaty Air Initiative, air quality in Almaty depends on many factors and varies throughout the four seasons and time of day. However, in winter, the main sources of pollution are the coal-fired CHPP-2 and CHPP-3. ""Almaty is located in a lowland, so air circulation is poor. During a temperature inversion, the upper layer of warm air acts like a lid, trapping cold and polluted air close to the ground. As a result, emissions accumulate below, and the concentration of pollution increases sharply. In winter, the main sources of pollution are coal-fired CHPP-2 and CHPP-3. They operate on coal with an ash content of 42%, without modern filtration systems. According to international estimates, the actual emissions of these facilities may be much higher than official figures. It should be noted that, according to Climate Trace data, CHPP-2 is among the 10% of the largest polluters in the world,"" says Zhuldyz Saulebekova, director of the fund. What is the proportion of vehicle exhaust in polluted air? The contribution of traffic to air quality in a metropolis depends on the season, traffic flow, and weather. In addition, the formation of smog is also affected by the private sector and air coming from the region. ""According to our observations, it is not advisable to assess the share of transport only by total emissions. It strongly depends on the season, traffic density and weather. During inversions and traffic jams, the share of transport emissions reaches 60–70% in terms of PM₂.₅ and NO₂ (nitrogen dioxide). And when there is good ventilation, it drops to 15–20%. In addition, in the cold season, the air is significantly polluted by the private sector. There, coal, fuel and waste are still used for heating. During adverse weather conditions, polluted air from the Almaty region is drawn towards the city, which further increases the level of smog and pollution,"" the specialist says. Which area has the dirtiest air? Experts have named the areas in the city with the dirtiest air and the relatively cleanest. ""The worst situation is observed in the northern (lower) part of the city and along highways. The ""plate effect"" (inversion and weak air exchange at the foot of the mountains) retains pollution, and vehicles, especially near roads, increase the level of NO₂. Now the map clearly shows the ""red"" readings of sensors in densely built-up areas, in the private sector burning coal, near large sources such as baths, taverns and CHP. The southern districts (Medeu and Bostandyk districts) are relatively clean. Here the average annual concentration is two times lower than in the northeastern parts of the city,"" says Zhuldyz Saulebekova. How can we solve the problem of polluted air in Almaty? According to experts, improving air quality requires a comprehensive approach that includes technological and management solutions: Gasification and modernization of CHP plants, installation of effective filtration systems, and strict emission control. A private sector coal phase-out program and the gradual connection of homes to gas or central heating systems. And where this is not yet possible, at least switching to briquetted or low-sulfur fuels, which will significantly reduce emissions. Develop environmentally friendly and affordable public transport, introduce Low Emission Zones to limit the impact of older vehicles, and encourage the transition to electric vehicles. Making data transparent means automatically monitoring emissions and publicly publishing the results, closing legislative loopholes that allow polluters to evade responsibility. The level of air pollution in winter is equivalent to inhaling 70 cigarettes a month, this is not a myth The representative of the foundation shared the results of research in recent years. According to the data, in 2024, the level of air pollution was assessed as high. The amount of harmful substances in the air exceeded the permissible limit up to 30 times a day. ""According to our data for 2024, the concentration of PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is 4-6 times higher than the World Health Organization's recommendations. From November to February, the pollution level is equivalent to inhaling 70 cigarettes per month. In winter, the concentration of PM2.5 is about 5 times higher than in summer, and NO₂ is 2 times higher. This excess is maintained throughout the year. According to Kazhydromet, in 2024, the level of air pollution was assessed as high: 11,024 exceedances of the limit were recorded for NO₂, that is, the amount of this harmful substance in the air exceeded the limit up to 30 times per day. In addition, ozone was recorded more than 1,000 times in excess of the limit, and the average daily levels of ozone and nitrogen oxides often exceeded the norm. The situation has not improved significantly compared to 2020, when Kazhydromet also assessed air pollution as high,"" he says. The main change is the openness of the data. Anyone can monitor the level of the cloud. Today, hundreds of sensors are installed in Almaty that measure pollution levels in real time. While the idea of ​​air pollution in a megacity used to seem abstract, now it is not only visible, but also clearly understood, says Zhuldyz Saulebekova. ""The main change in recent years is data transparency. Thanks to the efforts of the Almaty Air Initiative and sponsors, hundreds of sensors have been installed in the city that measure pollution levels in real time. All data is open to everyone. The data can be viewed in the MyCar application and on the dashboard.air.org.kz dashboard launched this year. Here, each resident can see the indicators of their air and compare them by year, month, hour, and district. If earlier this problem seemed abstract, now it has become visible and measurable. The tools, data, and demand necessary for the city to move to systematic solutions have appeared. A mobile application is also being developed to make monitoring even more convenient and accessible,"" says the director of the Foundation for Combating Air Pollution. Almaty is currently ranked 4th in the world for air quality. The top three are Pakistan, India, and China. What should we do to improve the air quality in Almaty? The fund's specialists and eco-activists have named simple but systematic steps that everyone can take and start: Use your personal car as little as possible, take public transport, walk or use car sharing and cycling. Monitoring the condition of the car, a properly functioning engine and an installed catalytic converter can significantly reduce toxic emissions. Not removing the catalytic converter, timely passing technical inspections, and not using fuel of questionable quality. Avoid burning trash, leaves, tires, and debris. These are one of the main sources of dioxins and fine particles in the air. Avoid setting off fireworks and burning open fires. These pollute the air with heavy metals and fine particles. Energy efficiency at home - thermal insulation, modern heating devices, and responsible consumption of electricity - reduces the load on thermal power plants and the overall volume of emissions. Monitor air quality at dashboard.air.org.kz and take it into account in your planning. The most important thing is to talk about the problem and create a culture of environmental responsibility. When people become more aware of the connection between their actions and air quality, not only behavior changes, but also the city itself. What experience has been used abroad? Beijing was one of the most polluted cities in the world a decade ago, but in recent years it has managed to significantly reduce the concentration of harmful substances. To do this, old coal-fired power plants were closed, renovated, converted to gas, old car traffic was restricted, public transport was developed, and industrial emissions were strictly controlled. Beijing has a single digital monitoring system that combines data from thousands of ground stations, satellites, and meteorological services. The introduction of Low Emission Zones (LEZ) and Ultra Low Emission Zones (ULEZ) in European cities such as London and Berlin has shown promising results in reducing NO₂ levels by 20–60% and shifting vehicles to cleaner modes. Barcelona and Shenzhen are using smart traffic lights that control traffic in real time using artificial intelligence analysis. This reduces congestion and, therefore, the generation of polluted air. In Amsterdam, an artificial intelligence energy management system analyzes data from ""smart"" meters and weather forecasts to balance energy consumption and reduce costs.",https://stan.kz/zhilu-ortaliginin-gazga-auisui-almatidagi-las-aua-probl-425327/

For Almaty, emission scenario modelling results are available for both prevailing and worst-case meteorological conditions, demonstrating the scale of potential impacts on residential areas. What else is important? Since CHPP-2 and CHPP-3 use high-ash coal, they are considered among the main causes of high PM 2.5 concentrations in the city. Due to the burning of solid fuels in winter and unfavorable weather conditions, Almaty topped the IQair online ranking of cities with the most polluted air during certain hours last season. The Almaty Air Initiative Foundation supports the initiative to convert the city's combined heat and power plants (CHPs) to natural gas . The foundation believes this should reduce emissions from CHP-2 by 12 times , and from CHP-3 by approximately 8-9 times .

However, the minister, who visited the construction sites, was not satisfied. Based on extensive research , a correspondent for the Caravan.kz media portal tried to find out when the transition to gas will be completed and the amount of money spent on it. Even the question of how much the ecology and air quality will improve after the transition is worrying society.

Energy Minister Yerlan Akkenzhenov visited the construction sites of CHPP-2 and CHPP-3 in Almaty. Dissatisfied with the pace of work on the second facility , he demanded that contractors accelerate the work. He also warned that video surveillance would be installed to monitor the construction progress, and that deadlines would not be missed.

It is worth noting that the CHP-2, which is being rebuilt , was promised to be converted to gas by 2025. Later, the deadline was moved to September 2026. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev also spoke about accelerating the pace of work in 2021. And the very first task was given by the then President Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2017. At that time, the deadline was set for 2020. It should be noted that the construction site is located near the current coal-fired station.

Almaty residents have high hopes that if CHP plants switch to gas, the city's air will be cleaner. However, the current reality is different. Almaty is consistently ranked in the top 10 in terms of air pollution . For example, in October last year, the city ranked fourth after Lahore, Karachi, and Delhi.

What is the stage of construction of CHP-3, which the minister criticized?

A week before the Minister of Energy visited the construction site, the Almaty City Department of Energy and Water Supply responded to a question from Shishkin_like and reported that the design and estimate documentation for CHP-3 was undergoing a comprehensive external state examination. According to the department, preparatory and preliminary work had been carried out at the construction site, most of the main equipment had been delivered, some was on the way, and some was at the production stage. It is worth noting that CHP-3 is not being built from scratch, it is only being modernized, that is, a gas station is being built.

How will the transition to gas be technically implemented after construction is completed?

Almaty city and region are provided with heat and electricity by Almaty Electric Power Plants JSC (“AlES”), a subsidiary of Samruk-Energo. The enterprise has a number of heat and power facilities, including CHP-2 and CHP-3. It is the owner, operator and user of these plants. In response to our inquiry, the company’s specialists explained that after the gas-fired thermal power plant at CHP-2 is launched, the existing coal-fired equipment will be phased out and conserved. The response received by the editorial office before the minister’s visit generally stated that commissioning and adjustment work is planned for 2026–2027. It is not yet known whether the minister’s visit will affect the change in deadlines. The AlES website indicates that the gas station at CHP-3 is scheduled to be commissioned in December 2026, and the coal station is scheduled to be dismantled in 2027.

In general, during the transition period, AlES is considering the possibility of using two types of fuel simultaneously. According to the operator, all measures to switch to gas are planned to avoid disruptions in heat supply during the heating season, including during peak loads.

What equipment will be installed?

CHPP-2 will be equipped with 4 water heaters and 3 steam boilers manufactured by the Chinese company Wuxi Huaguang Environment & Energy Group, as well as three waste heat boilers manufactured by the MHI Power Dongfang Boiler company. In addition, three gas turbine units manufactured by the German company Siemens Energy are planned. The generators are manufactured at one of Siemens' production sites in the USA. The main suppliers will provide service obligations for three years, after which maintenance and service will be carried out within the framework of the operating agreements between ""AlES"", contractors and equipment suppliers.

The design service life of CHP-2 is 30 years. Depending on the results of the subsequent technical analysis, the issue of major reconstruction, modernization or phased replacement of equipment will be resolved. As noted in the Energy Department, plans are usually developed for such facilities to extend their service life by major repairs and replacement of worn-out components. The installed electric capacity after switching to gas is 557 MW, thermal capacity is 957 Gcal/h.

CHPP-3 is also expected to operate for 30 years after modernization. The project plans to commission two combined cycle units. Today, the EPC contractor has signed contracts for the supply of key process equipment. In particular, gas turbines and generators from Ansaldo Energy (Italy), waste heat boilers from ZIO-Podolsk (Russia), and steam turbines and generators from Dongfang Electric International Corporation (China). The installed electrical capacity after switching to gas is up to 543.6 MW, and thermal capacity is up to 160 Gcal/h.

How much does it cost to convert CHP-2 to gas?

Within the framework of the project ""Modernization of Almaty CHP-2 with reduced environmental impact"", an EPC contract for the amount of 325.9 billion tenge was signed in May 2023 through the platform of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. This was reported by both the city's Energy and Water Supply Department and the Ministry of Energy. It is worth noting that the cost of the project on the website of the Development Bank of Kazakhstan is indicated as approximately 435.8 billion tenge . The bank may have updated this information due to changes in exchange rates.

Financing will be carried out at the expense of AlES's own funds and the authorized capital of Samruk-Energo JSC, as well as through loans from the EBRD, the Asian Development Bank and DBK. All credit lines provide for repayment within 15 years. However, AlES stated that the subject of financing is a commercial secret, and therefore this information cannot be disclosed. Bes.Media reported that in November 2022, AlES concluded loan agreements with the EBRD for 130 billion tenge (the bank's website indicates 126 billion tenge for 2022), in June 2023 with DBK for 117 billion tenge and with ADB for 98 billion tenge. According to DBK, the borrower's own share is approximately 87.2 billion tenge, and the loan cost is 0.73% per annum.

Construction work is being carried out by a consortium of Chinese corporations including Dongfang Electric International Corporation, PowerChina SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction, and PowerChina Hebei Electric Power Engineering.

Cost of reconstruction of CHPP-3 and contractors

According to the EPC contract, the project is estimated at more than 256.9 billion tenge . It is also being implemented at the expense of AlES' own funds and loans. Among the sources of financing are the Eurasian Development Bank, DBK and Halyk Bank. For financing, AlES issued bonds in the AIFC for 236.9 billion tenge . Of which, the EADB assumed the obligation to purchase bonds and concluded an agreement with AlES for 188 billion tenge.

How much will the performance of CHP-2 and CHP-3 improve?

Harmful substances

According to the Ministry of Energy, after switching to gas, it is expected that emissions of harmful substances from CHP-2 will decrease annually by 93% (from 37.1 thousand tons to 2.7 thousand tons, i.e. 14 times). For CHP-3, this figure will decrease by 88% - from 12.3 thousand tons to 1.5 thousand tons, i.e. 8 times. According to the Almaty Air Initiative, the transition of urban thermal power plants to gas will reduce emissions from CHP-2 by 12 times, and from CHP-3 by about 8–9 times. Recall that the concept of ""emissions of harmful substances"" includes a wide range of indicators, from fine particulate matter to heavy metals .

Greenhouse gas

According to the ministry, as a result of the operation of CHP-2, carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas) emissions will decrease by 38% (from 4 million tons to 2.5 million tons). For CHP-3, this figure will be 8% (from 1.5 million tons to 1.4 million tons). On average, the reduction for both stations will be 23%. This is in line with the forecasts published in the ""KazNTZU Bulletin"" for 2021 , which indicated that the volume of greenhouse gases will decrease by 20.4%.

Smog

Nitrogen oxides are considered one of the main causes of photochemical smog. A document authored by the AIFC states that the modernization of CHP-2 will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by about 45%. And recently, at a meeting of the Presidential Council on the ""transition to a green economy"", it was announced that nitrogen oxide emissions will decrease by about 95%. Perhaps this is a combined indicator of two CHPs.

What pollutes the air: cars or CHP plants?

This question is hotly debated in society. Let's take a look at the opinions on this topic.

In 2018, Bauyrzhan Baibek, the mayor of Almaty, said that 70% of emissions were attributed to transport. Fact-checking conducted at the time showed that in December, the share of transport in terms of sulfur dioxide was 37%, and in terms of carbon monoxide (carbon monoxide) it was 62%.

During the same period, studies of the Almaty ecosystem conducted by the foresight agency EXIMAR showed that approximately 70% of pollutants emitted into the air were emitted by three CHP plants and coal-fired boilers.

Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the former mayor of Almaty, stated at one of the reporting meetings in 2021 that more than 60% of air pollution is caused by vehicles, about 30% by CHP-2, and the rest by industry, private homes, and other sources . Moreover, he spoke about this issue in the past tense, that is, he gave the impression that the problem had been solved during his time.

An article in the 2021 KazNTZU Bulletin states that transport is responsible for 33.2% of the total greenhouse gas emissions and 52% of pollutants. It is worth noting that the number of cars in the city is steadily growing, in May 2025 their number increased by more than 11% compared to the same period last year. This applies only to locally registered vehicles.

Of course, the conversion of CHP-2 and CHP-3 to gas will improve air quality. But it is not yet possible to say exactly how much it will be. Last year, 189 thousand tons of pollutants were recorded in the Almaty air basin. According to official statistics , 112 thousand tons or 60% of them are from transport, 52 thousand tons or 27.5% from industrial enterprises (including CHP-2 and CHP-3), and 21 thousand tons or 11% from the private sector.

There is an opinion that air pollution may persist even after CHPs switch to gas. According to Climate TRACE data (which monitors emissions using satellite data), CHP-1, which has been operating on gas since 2017, emitted more than 20 tons of particles into the atmosphere that could be hazardous to health in 2024. This is likely due to fuel oil used as a backup fuel .",https://kaz.caravan.kz/zhangalyqtar/almaty-zhylu-jelektr-ortalyktary-gazga-koshse-jekologija-kanshalykty-zhaksarady/

Seoul is also in the danger zone.,Newstree.kr,"September 25, 2025","It has been revealed that harmful substances emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels are threatening the health of at least 1.6 billion people. This is because ultrafine dust (PM2.5) emitted during the combustion of coal and oil has adverse health effects. According to an interactive map created by Climate Trace, a global greenhouse gas measurement organization, on the 24th (local time), fine dust and other air pollutants are entering the air near the homes of approximately 1.6 billion people. This interactive map, using satellite and sensor data, shows the flow of air pollutants into over 2,500 urban areas. The map is publicly accessible and accessible to anyone. According to the data, approximately 900 million of the world's 1.6 billion people live near high-emission industrial facilities, such as power plants, refineries, ports, and mines. The more pollutants a facility emits, the more pollutants it releases into the atmosphere. Seoul, South Korea, was included among the cities particularly severely affected by air pollutants. Ten other cities were also named, including New York, USA; Guangzhou, China; and Karachi, Pakistan. Climate Tracking said, ""This map shows the direct link between the climate crisis and the serious threat air pollution poses to public health,"" and added, ""Identifying which communities are most at risk is an urgent priority."" Some in the United States see this data as a way to counter President Donald Trump's efforts to dismantle climate action. The Trump administration, which supports fossil fuels and denies climate change and renewable energy, has argued that it is willing to address pollution in any way it can. Ed Russo, Trump's environmental adviser, said at Climate Week in Rio de Janeiro in August that ""we must combat pollution from dumps, landfills, and other sources,"" but did not specify how the Trump administration would address pollution. Environmental groups are concerned that the size of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a key regulatory agency, will be reduced, making it less effective in addressing pollution. Al Gore, former U.S. Vice President and co-founder of Climate Trace, said there is a clear link between health and fossil fuels, noting that ""air pollution from fossil fuel combustion facilities is carried by the wind to surrounding areas and causes 8.7 million deaths each year.""",https://www.newstree.kr/newsView/ntr202509250021

Particle pollution kills millions of people worldwide each year, and tens of thousands in the United States alone, according to research reports. Gore's coalition uses 300 satellites, 30,000 ground-based tracking sensors, and AI to track 137,095 particle pollution sources, 3,937 of which are classified as ""mega-sources"" based on their emissions. Gore hopes that within about a year, these trends will be available daily and could be integrated into weather apps, much like allergy reports. This system not only tracks pollutants, but also traces their sources.
 

 ""Before AI, it was difficult for people to know exactly where air pollution was coming from,"" Gore said. ""But when pollution is removed from homes and neighborhoods, and people are clearly aware of it, they will know the truth about their situation, and knowing the truth will be liberating.""
 

 Unlike methane, soot pollution doesn't technically contribute to global warming, so it's not a climate issue. However, it is still caused by fossil fuel combustion. Gore said, ""Nearly 9 million people die every year from greenhouse gas pollution and fine dust pollution, both of which are caused by burning fossil fuels."" He said that if the 105-kilometer-long ""Cancer Alley"" between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, where the U.S. petrochemical industry is based, were considered a single country, it would have the fourth-highest per capita emissions of global warming pollutants in the world, after Turkmenistan, according to Climate Trace data analysis.

This must change immediately, the health of Skopje residents is at stake, half a million residents, children, adults, young people, everyone is affected, "" said Katerina Canevska Arsovska , a councilor in the City Council of Skopje, at a press conference yesterday . She requested the convening of an extraordinary session and requested support from all council groups for the measures that SDSM will propose to the Council, which are free public transportation on days when the air is polluted, requesting money from the Government for free filters on the chimneys of major polluters, repurposing money for purifiers for citizens for ecological heating, enacting a ban on heating with wood and coal in areas with available central heating, clearing illegal landfills on the territory of the City of Skopje, washing the streets, and money for ecological projects. In December 2019, as part of the ""Conversations for the Reconstruction of Macedonia"" campaign, Mickoski, then from an opposition position, promised to reduce air pollution by 50 percent and a billion euros for gasification and environmental measures.

Marjan Kalevski , a councilor from Green Human City, says that all this time we have all been waiting for the development of some plans, and even those that have been adopted are not being implemented. "" Many such documents proposed by the City of Skopje are copied from each other, every year with outdated information, without any weight to that document.

In addition, a lot of money is spent on the preparation of those plans. This plan will cost 75,000 euros ,"" Kalevski said in an interview with Telma. The 2024 election program ""Macedonia is Yours,"" the program with which VMRO-DPMNE came to power, has a whole chapter and dozens of measures envisaged for environmental protection. From the establishment of an Environmental Fund, a Central Inspection Body and a Green Fund, through support for households for the purchase of new energy equipment, to the development of a Methodology for the Prevention of Pollution from Urban Communities and a Methodology for Solving the Problem of Air Pollution from Large Capacities Located Close to Urban Areas. The party also promised immediate protection of lakes and national parks, the installation of electric vehicle charging stations at every gas station, as well as the reforestation of Macedonia with 10 million seedlings per year. A year and a half later, neither reforestation has been carried out, nor are there pumps for electric vehicles at every gas station. Even fewer have the organs and bodies that VMRO-DPMNE promised been formed. As for the national parks, this party promised that Pelister, Galichica, Mavrovo and Shar Planina will receive systemic financial support to fulfill the basic goal of their operation - environmental protection. However, the non-governmental sector warned in June this year that for years the authorities have been doing nothing to have Mavrovo declared a national (NP) park again. "" The law on the re-proclamation of Mavrovo National Park has not been adopted, the Mavrovo National Park Management Plan has not been adopted, numerous irregularities and illegal activities in the park have been reported, but have not been sanctioned.

And the establishment of the Environmental Fund is also part of the 2016 election program ""Plan for Life in Macedonia"" with which SDSM came to power. In addition to the fund, this party promised an integrated system that would connect all three monitoring systems that track air, water and soil pollution, and the data would be publicly available to citizens. "" The priority is the construction of wastewater treatment plants in all settlements with over 10,000 inhabitants, but also in smaller urban areas. We will make a map of contaminated soils in the country. We will complete the legislation on soil protection. We will develop a 'Cadastre of areas threatened by natural disasters in Macedonia with a degree of risk', which will define red zones (no construction allowed), yellow zones (construction is possible, but only with protective measures) and green zones (free for construction). We will regulate the catchment areas, clean the riverbeds and the canal system. Every year we will invest 10 million euros a year just for irrigation and drainage systems. We will establish a modern hydrometeorological system for early warning in case of storm risk ,"" SDSM promised at the time. Almost ten years later, villages and towns are still flooding, there is no cadastre of endangered areas, there are not even 10 million euros per year for irrigation and drainage systems, nor has a hydrometeorological system been established for early warning in case of storm risk. Last week, the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning warned twice about extreme pollution in Kicevo, Strumica and Skopje . The National Development Strategy (NDS) 2024-2044, among other things, foresees the state to work intensively on green energy transformation. "" The primary goal in this direction is to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality and improve energy efficiency, thereby ensuring a healthier living environment for citizens. At the same time, the waste and wastewater management system needs to be renovated by increasing recycling rates and establishing standardized landfills, which will reduce our ecological footprint. The protection of nature and biodiversity is essential for improving the environment ,"" the NDS 2024-2044 states. To implement this plan, the National Development Strategy 2024-2044 envisages building a climate-neutral society with a low percentage of energy poverty and a healthy and clean environment.

""The initiative proposes that the Mayor of the City of Skopje submit this position to the Government, the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, the State Environmental Inspectorate and the Parliament, so that they can further act within their competences. The Usje Cement Plant is a heavy and highly polluting industry installation (G1) that has been operating in the immediate vicinity of populated areas of Skopje for decades. Its location is a historical anachronism and directly contradicts the constitutionally guaranteed right of citizens to a healthy environment, as well as modern standards for the protection of public health. According to data from Climate Trace - one of the most relevant global sources for monitoring pollution - the Usje Cement Plant is among the 10% largest polluters in the world and is classified as a super emitter of PM2.5 particles. This further confirms the serious and long-term impact of this installation on air quality in Skopje. The inspection findings from 2023 showed serious systemic failures in institutional supervision. Reports have been accepted for emissions with gaps of 10 hours in 24 hours, contrary to the Regulation on Emission Measurement and from a monitoring station controlled by the cement plant itself. These findings resulted in a criminal complaint filed by the City of Skopje in January 2023. Despite this, neither a ban on operation, nor effective measures to drastically reduce pollution, nor the installation of independent measuring stations around Usje followed. Additionally, in September 2025, the Ministry of Environment proposed, and the Parliament adopted, a law by which, for the first time in the history of Macedonia, industrial pollution was classified as a ""trade secret"" - a law that was welcomed and positively assessed by Usje.

In such an environment, ""Green Human City"" raised the temperature of the public debate and directly pointed to the cement plant ""Usje"" as one of the biggest polluters in the capital, demanding that an institutional process be opened for its dislocation from Skopje. According to the initiative, submitted to the City Council of Skopje, ZHG requests that the councilors take a clear position, and that the mayor send that position to the Government, the Ministry of Environment, the State Inspectorate and the Parliament. The message is simple: if the city has the political will to be a ""city of citizens"", then there must also be a clear answer as to whether a highly polluting industry can remain in an urban core that has been struggling with air pollution for years. ZHG bases its thesis on data and rankings from the Climate TRACE platform and claims that it is a ""major polluter"" that is among the highest emitters worldwide, i.e. in the group of the largest emissions according to their analyses. The same public argumentation that was reported by the media also states that the heating plant in Kisela Voda appears among the world's largest polluters according to the same platform - data that further raises the question of how seriously the state treats large sources of emissions in and around the city, as opposed to the usual shifting of blame exclusively to households. This initiative does not come in vain. These days, official daily air quality reports record exceedances of the average daily concentrations of PM10 at several measuring points across the country, including the Skopje stations, which only confirms the image of a ""seasonal crisis"" that becomes a political test every year. When measuring points consistently exceed limits, citizens wonder why institutions continue to behave as if pollution is a temporary phenomenon, not a managed risk. This is where the most uncomfortable question for the City of Skopje comes in: what does “competence” mean when citizens are asking for air, not explanations? The new mayor Orce Gjorgjievski has already publicly stated that pollution has been a problem “for decades” and that it will not be solved overnight, which sounds rational, but in practice often serves as an alibi for another winter without a concrete turnaround. Therefore, the ZHG initiative presents the city government with a clear choice: either it will open a process that has political weight and an institutional trajectory, or it will remain in the position of “we can do nothing”, while citizens once again take on the role of pressure through the streets. Meanwhile, the protest narrative is once again returning as a parallel institution. “Stop for Usje” announced a citizens’ blockade on December 25 at 6 p.m., at the intersection of “Boris Trajkovski” and “Srbija” boulevards, with the message that the air “will not clean itself.” Skopje is practically re-entering the model in which measuring stations sound the alarm, citizens organize blockades, and institutions communicate with sentences that sound as if they were written to avoid taking on a commitment.",https://racin.mk/vesti/skopje-pod-czement-zhg-bara-usje-da-se-disloczira-gradot-da-kazhe-dali-e-na-stranata-na-vozduhot/

MEX,"Climate TRACE data are used to identify major emissions hotspots in Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Puebla, and the port of Manzanillo, and to highlight notable municipalities such as Ensenada, Lázaro Cárdenas, and Silao. The articles use facility‑level attribution to show geographic concentration of industrial and logistics emissions, without describing follow‑on actions.",These are the municipalities in Mexico that saw the greatest increase in pollution in 2025 ,Expansión ESG,"December 15, 2025","The climate crisis in Mexico is not only measured at the national level, but is also clearly evident at the municipal level. Recent data from Climate TRACE shows that 11 municipalities in Mexico account for 50.1% of the main pollutants that cause global warming, driven by industrial, energy, and logistics activities. 

The urban areas of Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Puebla and the port of Manzanillo concentrate 36.3% of the national inventory of carbon equivalent emissions (CO2e), making them the main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) generation in the country. 

This high participation rate is due to the high population density, intense industrial and logistical activity, as well as the concentration of services, transportation, and energy consumption. In the case of the port of Manzanillo, its importance is explained by the volume of maritime and land trade, which increases emissions associated with the transport of goods and the use of fossil fuels. 

The emissions recorded in these areas include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, gases with a high global warming potential and a direct impact on accelerating climate change. 
Municipalities such as Ensenada in Baja California, Lázaro Cárdenas in Michoacán, and Silao in Guanajuato have seen increases in their carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions of 8.2%, 6.0%, and 4.2%, respectively. These areas are home to industrial ports, automotive manufacturing hubs, power plants, and logistics centers, all of which contribute to increased environmental pressure. 

In the case of Ensenada, port activity, maritime and land transport, as well as electricity generation and the export-related industry, account for a significant portion of the increase in emissions. Added to this is urban growth linked to commerce and tourism, which increases energy demand and vehicular traffic. The combination of these sources makes the municipality a critical emissions hotspot within the northwest of the country. 

Lázaro Cárdenas stands out for housing one of the most important industrial ports on the Mexican Pacific coast, with intensive steel production, large-scale cargo handling, and a constant flow of heavy transport. These activities, fundamental to foreign trade and national industry, depend heavily on energy-intensive processes, resulting in higher CO2e emissions and increasing environmental pressure on the region. 

Silao, for its part, has established itself as a hub of the Bajío automotive corridor, with assembly plants, auto parts suppliers, and logistics centers operating continuously. Vehicle manufacturing, the transportation of raw materials and finished products, and the electricity demand of the industrial parks explain the increase in its emissions. 
Conversely, some municipalities in the country significantly reduced their carbon equivalent emissions, reflecting progress in energy efficiency, changes in production methods, or reduced industrial activity. Tuxtepec, Oaxaca, led the reductions with a 7.14% decrease, followed by Monclova, Coahuila, with 6.85%, and Puebla, Puebla, with a 5.66% reduction. 

This trend was also seen in Agua Prieta, Sonora, where emissions fell by 5.01%, and Orizaba, Veracruz, with a 5% decrease. These results contrast with the increases observed in other industrial centers and show that these municipalities share similar local policies and improved urban management, according to information from their websites. 

The Government of Mexico, within its National Air Quality Strategy, mentions that municipalities, as part of the three levels of government, have a fundamental role in reducing polluting emissions, especially through shared and comprehensive air quality management and the reorientation of urban planning. 

The municipal contribution is based on integrating air quality into territorial and mobility planning and strengthening its operational and regulatory capacity to implement local management programs (ProAire) and monitor emission sources. The document states that this represents a shift so that addressing air quality is no longer the exclusive responsibility of environmental authorities.

According to estimates for the year 2024, the ten largest polluters in Serbia produced more than 31 million tons of CO2, which is more than 60 percent of the total emissions in the country. In first place is the Nikola Tesla Thermal Power Plant (TENT) with 15.59 million tons, followed by Kostolac TE with 6.92 million and NIS 's oil and gas extraction with 5.37 million tons. The list also includes Železara Smederevo (1.96 million tons), TPP Kolubara, Novi Sad heating plant, TPP Morava , as well as the Tamnava and Radljevo mines . Among the top ten is the Pancevo Refinery with 0.81 million tons of CO2. One of the industries that currently consumes only oil derivatives is in 11th place: ""Nikola Tesla"" Airport , with 0.52 million tons, writes the Klima101 portal. Experts warn that thermal power plants are still the biggest source of emissions in Serbia, but that the steel and oil industries, which depend on the import of raw materials, are also a significant part of the problem. ""When raw materials travel from South Africa, Brazil or China to reach Smederevo, it is clear that the issue of sustainability transcends national borders,"" said Dr. Mirko Nikolić from Södertörn University in Sweden. According to the same source, emissions in Serbia increased by 4.7 percent between 2021 and 2024, which is contrary to the obligations that the country undertook under the Paris Agreement.",https://una.rs/vesti/satelitski-snimci-otkrili-najvece-zagadivace-u-srbiji-termoelektrane-prednjace-na-listi-i-aerodrom

The ten largest emitters in Serbia together produce over 31 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, which is over 60% of Serbia's total territorial emissions. This is what the Climate TRACE portal tells us , a non-profit coalition of organizations that uses data from over 300 satellites and sensors, and processes data with the help of artificial intelligence to obtain results from over 600 million sources of pollution around the world . The aim is to avoid the standard pain associated with reporting emissions of CO 2 and other harmful gases: traditional inventories rely on companies self-reporting their emissions (or not reporting them at all). The data is rounded up on a monthly basis and gives an almost ""live"" picture. In the text, we look primarily at the calculations for the year 2024. As the satellite data tell us, quite expectedly, thermal power plants are at the top of the list of the largest emitters in Serbia . The Nikola Tesla thermal power plant (TENT) is unparalleled, with its 15.59 million tons of CO 2 in 2024, followed by the Kostolac thermal power plant with 6.92 million, the Kolubara thermal power plant with 1.04, then the Novi Sad thermal power plant with 0.66 and the Morava thermal power plant with 0.61 million tons of CO 2 . For the sake of comparison, according to Climate TRACE, last year Serbia emitted a total of just over 60 million tons of greenhouse gases (which includes CO 2 and other gases) - thermal power plants were almost half of that total figure , Dr. Mirko Nikolić from Sodertorn University in Sweden writes for Klima101. Not only the burning, but also the mining of coal causes extensive emissions: within the EPS, the Tamnava and Radljevo mines are on the list of the 10 largest emitters (with 0.74 and 0.58 million tons of greenhouse gases, respectively). These figures are not so far from the data provided by the official state inventories, and they confirm that coal is an absolutely central problem for climate action in Serbia. However, coal is not the only problem – nor is the emissions picture as simple as it might seem. Roads of steel: from South Africa, via Smederevo to the European Union The fourth largest emitter in Serbia is Železara Smederevo, with 1.96 million tons of CO 2 . This is less than the world average, where the steel industry accounts for 7-8% of total energy emissions. But here it would be good to do a short analysis, because there are also wider emissions related to the work of the Ironworks . Namely, Climate TRACE estimates emissions at the point of production , but this excludes key elements of steel processing, such as energy and raw materials. The company HBIS, the owner of the Smederevo Ironworks, is the fifth largest steel producer on the planet, and the Smederevo Ironworks is part of global supply chains, as well as greenhouse gas emissions. To begin with, it should be taken into account that all the ore used by Železara, as well as coke, is imported (a high-energy type of coal used in furnaces for melting steel). Železara also uses natural gas as an energy source, of which, as is known, about 90% is also imported. Until the beginning of the war in Ukraine, most of the ore and coke came from Russia and Ukraine, but since then there have been alternative supply channels, including: South Africa, Australia, Brazil , India and China . Bearing in mind that, in principle, the exact sources of supply and transport routes of materials are impossible to calculate more precisely the emissions they cause. Certainly, the very fact that some of these raw materials go around the entire planet to reach Smederevo raises the question of sustainability. Given the sources of the ore, this transport certainly takes place mostly by ships, which are a notorious hole in emissions reporting and do not ""belong"" to any country. And the path of raw materials and products does not stop there. About half of the Železara's production is exported, mainly to European Union markets, so if we look not at territorial emissions, but at country emissions by consumption, it could be said that half of the Železara's emissions are exported. However, the matter is not so simple, because it is certain that a part of the emissions may still travel through the final products. We should keep in mind that Serbia actually imports more steel products than it exports in terms of economic value . At the global level, the steel industry is seen as a challenge for decarbonization, and although intensive work is being done to switch to electricity and furnaces that use hydrogen, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that the steel industry is "" not on track "" to reach the so-called. net zero emissions by 2050. The mother company Železara ""Smederevo"" itself allegedly already makes ""green steel"" using hydrogen in its facilities in China, with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions, but unfortunately, as far as is known, there are no plans to install such technologies in Serbia . Oil: Upstream and downstream of the refinery Somewhat similar problems of wider emission flows are also opened up by the operations of the Serbian Oil Industry, from the very extraction of oil and gas, as well as their processing. The largest item related to NIS is the extraction of oil and gas in Vojvodina, which Climate TRACE estimates at 5.37 million tons, which places this activity in 3rd place in the country in 2024. According to the portal's methodology, only emissions caused during production and transportation are included here. Processing is counted as a separate activity, as Climate TRACE counts emissions at the facility level or geographically localized activities. The portal estimates that the Pancevo Refinery produces 0.81 million tons of greenhouse gases . To this should be added HIP-Petrohemija with 0.23 million tons. These numbers refer only to the processes that take place within the scope of production, ie. refining. For fossil companies, ""indirect"" emissions are key, which are both ""upstream"" ( upstream ) and ""downstream"" ( downstream ) of the Refinery. Most of the raw materials that NIS processes are imported, and most of the emissions are produced by burning finished products. In 2024, NIS processed over 3.6 million tons of oil derivatives , and sold over 3.7 million tons, and is by far the largest supplier of motor fuels on the market. In accordance with this, it should be remembered that the oil and gas industry is one of the key points for Serbia's climate policy, primarily in transport. One of the industries that currently consumes only petroleum products is in 11th place on the list (9th in 2023): ""Nikola Tesla"" Airport, with 0.52 million tons. It is known that the aviation industry's emissions are not covered by the Paris Agreement, although they are among the largest by individual sector, representing at least 2% of world emissions and even up to 4% of total warming, taking condensation effects into account. Formally speaking, currently these emissions are the sole responsibility of the companies themselves to reduce emissions and should be solved by the market, and progress in this matter is very slow. Of course, it should be borne in mind that the policies of construction, maintenance and expansion of airports are often actually political decisions, and the entire infrastructure depends on them. Therefore, the quantification of emissions related to individual airports opens up the possibility of political action in this field . How accurate are satellite figures? It is important to note that the estimates offered by Climate TRACE are not the only ones, and they do not always match the results provided by other measurement methods. The Global Carbon Project offers a slightly lower figure for Serbia's total emissions: 42.36 million tons in 2023, while Climate TRACE estimates 63.02 million tons for the same year. The differences are primarily due to different methodologies, but also to the range of measurements. Perhaps the biggest difference is that Climate TRACE also tracks other greenhouse gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. Next, Climate TRACE attempts to estimate emissions at the level of facilities and industrial activity, while the Global Carbon Project is based on estimates based on energy and fuel consumption, and their emission factors. An important note is that these figures fluctuate - although thermal power plants are always in first place, the rest of the top 10 changes somewhat from year to year, depending on the specific activities (as can be seen here: the text refers to the 2024 figures, the visual to the 2023 figures). The owners of our broadcasters and their policies HBIS , the 100% owner of Železara ""Smederevo"" at the group level, according to the Influence Map analysis , shows ""limited"" commitment and transparency regarding decarbonization, and the company's strategy is ""mostly not aligned"" with the Paris Agreement. Gazprom , the majority owner of NIS, according to the estimates of the Carbon Majors platform, is in the 6th position in terms of total individual emissions in history. This company is responsible for 2.32% of fossil emissions since the beginning of industrialization, which may be relevant from the perspective of ""responsibility"" for climate change. The same company, also according to the Influence Map analysis, does not generally support climate action, although it claims to work in accordance with the Paris Agreement. In addition to these international actors and their global supply chains, by far the largest share of greenhouse gases comes from domestic production and burning of coal, and action on this issue is imminent, but still critically overdue. We should also take into account the amount of emissions that are related to the use of motor fuels, Climate TRACE, for example. calculates emissions related to transport at the municipal level, with Novi Sad with 0.41 million, Palilula 0.38, Niš 0.27... The portal estimates that emissions related to road traffic are 10.91 million tons of CO 2 equivalents. In addition to the climate, there are also direct impacts on the health of the population related to heating plants, but also to transport, which is almost entirely based on fossil fuels. That there are a lot of tasks in the domestic yard is also evidenced by the fact that in 12th position (10th in 2023) in terms of emissions , the regional landfill in Subotica is associated with 0.42 million tons of CO 2 equivalents, while 0.28 million tons are associated with the landfill in Vinča (in total, waste disposal causes 2.33 million tons, or about 3.5% of all emissions). In addition to these largest emitters, the cement plants in Beočin and Popovac, in addition to local emissions of PM2.5 and PM10 particles, are ranked between 10th and 20th in this table from year to year. Here, it would also be relevant to take into account the broader picture of ""upstream"" and above all ""downstream"" emissions related to the further use of these materials in construction and infrastructure. Why is satellite data important? Climate TRACE provides estimates with varying levels of certainty, partly due to the quality of the source data ""from the ground"" (eg production volumes and technology), but provides an important complement to other estimates and calculations. First of all, this portal shows how important it is to have detailed and publicly available data and how important it would be for companies and local governments to approach emissions measurement and reporting in a transparent and up-to-date manner. The key questions for any climate action are ""where"" and ""how much"" . Otherwise, there is a danger that the policies are not properly directed and therefore not effective enough. What is particularly worrying is that according to Climate TRACE estimates, emissions at the state level are growing year by year, that in 2024 they were 4.7% more than in 2021 , which would be a movement in the wrong direction from the nationally determined contributions of the Republic of Serbia, as well as what is necessary to keep the warming within the framework of the Paris Agreement.",https://www.euronews.rs/srbija/drustvo/195312/deset-najvecih-emitera-co2-u-srbiji-i-njihove-posledice/vest 
TWN,"Climate TRACE data are used to rank Taiwan’s major electricity generators, including Mailiao, Taichung, Hsing Ta, Linkou, and the Third Nuclear Power Plant, as part of national emissions discussions. The coverage focuses on source identification rather than on post‑publication actions.","The goal of a ""nuclear-free homeland"" has been achieved, but the energy transition is still progressing against headwinds.",Newtalk (Taiwan),"January 1, 2026","On May 17, 2025, Taiwan officially entered the era of a ""nuclear-free homeland,"" a highly symbolic historical milestone. However, examining the actual structure of the energy transition, the originally set ""50:30:20"" (gas-fired, coal-fired, renewable energy) target was not achieved as scheduled. This reminds us that nuclear-free energy is only a phase in the transition, not the end.
 

 Looking solely at the Taipower system, the power structure from January to November 2025 was approximately 53% gas-fired, 27% coal-fired, and 13% renewable energy. However, if we further include self-consumption cogeneration systems and renewable energy generation under signed direct transfer contracts, the overall structure is closer to 48% gas-fired, 35% coal-fired, and 14% renewable energy. This gap highlights a crucial fact: the lagging progress in renewable energy development directly hinders the substantial progress of coal reduction.
 

 Against this backdrop, the Mailiao Thermal Power Plant plays a particularly critical role. Once hailed by some media outlets as a ""savior after the decommissioning of the Third Nuclear Power Plant,"" the Mailiao Power Plant completed its decoupling at the end of this year, officially exiting the Taipower system. This facility, once ranked the 68th largest carbon-emitting power plant globally in the Climate TRACE rankings, has significant climate and governance implications in its shutdown, demonstrating that Taiwan cannot solely rely on ""high-carbon replacement of high-carbon"" to fill the non-nuclear gap.
 

 However, what truly warrants attention is not just the retirement of existing coal-fired units, but the structural risks inherent in the gas-fired expansion path. According to the analysis in the report ""The Elephant Doesn't Want to Dance Yet,"" even assuming carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology can be commercialized as scheduled, the officially planned gas-fired power generation by 2035 will still exceed the net-zero scenario limit by 1.18 to 1.3 times; under a more aggressive renewable energy scenario, the gap could even approach two times.
 

 This means that under the net-zero transition path, the average capacity factor of gas-fired units will inevitably decline. Even based on official policy estimates, the capacity factor of gas turbine units is unlikely to exceed 50% by 2035, and may even drop to around 30% if renewable energy deployment accelerates. As for 2050, even with the full implementation of CCS or hydrogen energy, the overall gas turbine capacity factor will still only be around 43%.
 

 The problem lies in the fact that the environmental impact assessment for the new gas turbine unit in Mailiao is based on a 2400 MW installed capacity and an annual power generation of 17.8 billion kWh, meaning its capacity factor must be maintained above 84% for a long period. According to current net-zero policies, the actual operating life of this unit by 2035 may only be about 7 years, after which it will need to be significantly reduced, resulting in extremely high investment recovery risk and creating a typical stranded asset scenario.
 

 This is precisely the core contradiction of Taiwan's current energy transition: with the progress of renewable energy hindered, gas turbines are forced to assume an excessive transitional role, yet they cannot operate at high loads for long under the net-zero framework. Without a clearer exit and adjustment mechanism, gas turbines will transform from a transitional solution into a new structural burden.
 

 In summary, achieving a nuclear-free homeland does not signify a victory in the energy transition, but merely the prelude to the next phase of challenges. The energy transition is never a choice of a single technology or power source, but a systemic project involving investment recovery, industry risks, and governance capabilities. The key to the future lies not in how many more old problems are eliminated, but in whether we can establish alternatives sufficient to support a low-carbon structure. This path is destined to be long and costly, but there is no turning back.",https://newtalk.tw/citizen/view/70551

Among them, Taiwan's Taichung Power Plant, Mailiao Power Plant, Hsing Ta Power Plant, China Steel Corporation, and Linkou Power Plant were on the list. Gore: Humans are abusing the atmosphere, treating the sky like an open drainage ditch. In 2025, the climate mirror will appear for the fourth time, claiming to cover carbon emissions in every country, state and province on Earth, more than 9,000 metropolitan areas and 67 industries, revealing more than 740 million pollution sources, more than the 660 million last year. Overall, global greenhouse gas emissions increased by 0.55% in 2024 compared to the previous year, and the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached a record high. It is estimated that it will grow by another 0.39% in 2025. At COP30, Gore criticized humanity's continued abuse of the atmosphere as ""simply insane,"" adding, ""If we let this madness continue and treat the sky like an open drain, some of the consequences will be unmanageable."" Who was the world's dirtiest source of pollution last year? Let's look at single emission sources first. The top polluter remains oil and gas production in central Western Siberia, Russia, which has held the top spot for four consecutive years. However, its carbon emissions dropped by 17.1% last year, the largest decrease in four years. Of the world's top ten polluters, six are the production or transportation of oil and natural gas, but the other four are all forest fires. This marks another rise in the rankings of wildfires, following their placement in Canada and Australia among the top four and five globally last year. Bolivia now accounts for the second, third, fourth, and seventh positions, with the fires occurring in four provinces within the country. The Amazon basin, covering 43% of Bolivia's landmass, is a significant carbon sink for the planet. The forest fires in Ñuflo de Chávez Province, the world's second-largest emitter of carbon, account for 85% of Taiwan's total annual emissions. The combined carbon emissions from the forest fires in the four provinces are nearly three times that of Taiwan. According to satellite data from NASA's Earth Observatory at the end of 2024, nearly 90,000 forest fires occurred in Bolivia in 2024, the highest number in 27 years, burning an area of ​​nearly 16 million hectares, more than four times the size of Taiwan. Next, let's look at the country rankings. In 2024, the top five carbon emitters remained unchanged: China, the United States, India, Russia, and Brazil maintained their rankings from the previous year. The biggest change was in Bolivia, whose ranking jumped from 22nd to 8th due to massive forest fires. China remains at the top of the list, with its emissions still enormous and showing slight growth, but its global share has decreased slightly by 0.11 percentage points. In contrast, the global shares of the United States and India have increased slightly. Indonesia saw the largest reduction, nearly 60%; Bolivia increased by 159%, and Brazil, the host country of COP30, also increased by nearly 24%. How will Taiwan perform in 2024? So, how did Taiwan perform last year? (*Note: Due to changes in data and methodology, carbon emissions and rankings for each year have been recalculated by Climate Tracking. Please refer to the latest data on the Climate Tracking website API for details .) In 2024, Taiwan's total carbon emissions were approximately 315.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), a decrease of about 3 million metric tons from the previous year, a drop of nearly 1%. However, its global ranking moved up one place to 46th, lower than Ethiopia and higher than Peru. According to the latest climate tracking data, 2024 was the best year for Taiwanese companies in recent years. Eight Taiwanese companies were listed among the world's 1,000 dirtiest companies, one fewer than in 2023 and two fewer than in 2022. Taoyuan Airport IN, Heping Power Plant OUT In 2024, seven of Taiwan's top ten most polluting facilities were power plants, two were steel mills, and one was an international airport. Taoyuan International Airport entered the top ten for the first time. Heping Power Plant dropped off the list. Taichung Power Plant remains number one in carbon emissions, although its emissions decreased by 1.625 million tons (-4.86%) compared to last year. However, its global carbon pollution ranking improved by three places, rising from 70th to 67th, with emissions of 31.827 million tons. It ranks third among 9,482 power plants worldwide. If Taichung Power Plant were a country, it would rank 133rd globally in carbon emissions, lower than Croatia but higher than Bahrain. The Mailiao Power Plant retained its second-place ranking in Taiwan and ""improved"" 11 places globally, moving from 249th to 260th. Its carbon emissions reached 16.578 million tons, a 2.6% decrease from last year, exceeding El Salvador's total emissions. If the Mailiao Power Plant were a country, it would be ranked 148th globally. China Steel's Xiaogang Plant has replaced last year's Linkou Power Plant to rank third in Taiwan's overall pollution rankings, moving up one place nationwide and 66 places globally, from 404th to 338th. Compared to last year, the plant's carbon emissions increased by 10.2%, approximately 14.553 million tons. If the Xiaogang Plant were a country, it would rank 150th globally, higher than the entire emissions of the East African nation of Burundi. The country with the biggest ""rise"" in global rankings is Taoyuan International Airport. For the first time, it has broken into the top 1,000 in global carbon pollution rankings, jumping from 1210th to 994th, a rise of 216 places – the largest ""fall"". Among its 2200 global peers, it retained its 16th place ranking. The plant that ""dropped"" the most in global rankings was the Heping Power Plant. Not only did its emissions fall out of the top ten in Taiwan, but its global ranking also dropped out of the top 1,000, falling from 954th to 1069th, a drop of 115 places.

Four of the World's Top Ten Carbon Emission Makers are Forest Fires; Taoyuan Airport Enters Taiwan's Top Ten Carbon Emission Makers for the First Time; Heping Power Plant Shows the Most Improvement in Global Ranking; Linkou Power Plant Becomes the Carbon Reduction King.,CSR,"December 19, 2025","Four years ago, former US Vice President Al Gore opened the ""Climate Tracking"" system at COP27, which combined satellite, sensor, and countless public and commercial data with AI integrated computing to expose the world's 500 dirtiest carbon emission sources. Among them, Taiwan's Taichung Power Plant, Mailiao Power Plant, Hsing Ta Power Plant, China Steel Corporation, and Linkou Power Plant were on the list. Gore: Humans are abusing the atmosphere, treating the sky like an open drainage ditch. In 2025, the climate mirror will appear for the fourth time, claiming to cover carbon emissions in every country, state and province on Earth, more than 9,000 metropolitan areas and 67 industries, revealing more than 740 million pollution sources, more than the 660 million last year. Overall, global greenhouse gas emissions increased by 0.55% in 2024 compared to the previous year, and the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached a record high. It is estimated that it will grow by another 0.39% in 2025. At COP30, Gore criticized humanity's continued abuse of the atmosphere as ""simply insane,"" adding, ""If we let this madness continue and treat the sky like an open drain, some of the consequences will be unmanageable."" Who was the world's dirtiest source of pollution last year? Let's look at single emission sources first. The top polluter remains oil and gas production in central Western Siberia, Russia, which has held the top spot for four consecutive years. However, its carbon emissions dropped by 17.1% last year, the largest decrease in four years. Of the world's top ten polluters, six are the production or transportation of oil and natural gas, but the other four are all forest fires. Following last year's surge in the rankings of wildfires in Canada and Australia, which placed them among the top four and five globally, wildfires have once again climbed the list, now occupying the second, third, fourth, and seventh spots, all located in four provinces within Bolivia. 43% of Bolivia's landmass lies within the Amazon basin, a crucial carbon sink for the planet. The forest fires in Ñuflo de Chávez Province, the world's second-largest emitter of carbon, account for 85% of Taiwan's total annual emissions. The combined carbon emissions from the forest fires in the four provinces are nearly three times that of Taiwan. According to satellite data from NASA's Earth Observatory at the end of 2024, nearly 90,000 forest fires occurred in Bolivia in 2024, the highest number in 27 years, burning an area of ​​nearly 16 million hectares, more than four times the size of Taiwan. Next, let's look at the country rankings. In 2024, the top five carbon emitters remained unchanged: China, the United States, India, Russia, and Brazil maintained their rankings from the previous year. The biggest change was in Bolivia, whose ranking soared from 22nd to 8th due to massive forest fires. China remains at the top of the list, with its emissions still enormous and showing slight growth, but its global share has decreased slightly by 0.11 percentage points. In contrast, the global shares of the United States and India have increased slightly. Indonesia saw the largest reduction, with a reduction of nearly 60%; Bolivia increased by 159%, and Brazil, the host country of COP30, also increased by nearly 24%. How will Taiwan perform in 2024? So, how did Taiwan perform last year? (*Note: Due to changes in data and methodology, carbon emissions and rankings for each year have been recalculated by Climate Tracking. Please refer to the latest data on the Climate Tracking website API for details .) In 2024, Taiwan's total carbon emissions were approximately 315.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), a decrease of about 3 million metric tons from the previous year, a drop of nearly 1%. However, its global ranking moved up one place to 46th, lower than Ethiopia and higher than Peru. According to the latest climate tracking data, 2024 was the best year for Taiwanese companies in recent years. Eight Taiwanese companies were listed among the world's 1,000 dirtiest companies, one fewer than in 2023 and two fewer than in 2022. Taoyuan Airport IN, Heping Power Plant OUT In 2024, seven of Taiwan's top ten most polluting facilities were power plants, two were steel mills, and one was an international airport. Taoyuan International Airport entered the top ten for the first time. Heping Power Plant dropped off the list. Taichung Power Plant remains the world's largest carbon emitter, although its carbon emissions decreased by 1.625 million tons (-4.86%) compared to last year. However, it rose three places in the global carbon pollution rankings, from 70th to 67th, with carbon emissions of 31.827 million tons. It ranks third among 9,482 power plants worldwide. If Taichung Power Plant were a country, it would rank 133rd globally in carbon emissions, lower than Croatia but higher than Bahrain. The Mailiao Power Plant retained its second-place ranking in Taiwan and ""improved"" 11 places globally, moving from 249th to 260th. Its carbon emissions reached 16.578 million tons, a 2.6% decrease from last year, exceeding El Salvador's total emissions. If the Mailiao Power Plant were a country, it would be ranked 148th globally. China Steel's Xiaogang Plant has replaced last year's Linkou Power Plant to rank third in Taiwan's overall pollution rankings, moving up one place nationwide and 66 places globally, from 404th to 338th. Compared to last year, the plant's carbon emissions increased by 10.2%, approximately 14.553 million tons. If the Xiaogang Plant were a country, it would rank 150th globally, higher than the entire emissions of the East African nation of Burundi. The country with the biggest ""rise"" in global rankings is Taoyuan International Airport. For the first time, it has broken into the top 1,000 in global carbon pollution rankings, jumping from 1210th to 994th, a rise of 216 places – the largest ""fall"". Among its 2200 global peers, it retained its 16th place ranking. The plant that ""dropped"" the most in global rankings was the Heping Power Plant. Not only did its emissions fall out of the top ten in Taiwan, but its global ranking also dropped out of the top 1,000, falling from 954th to 1069th, a drop of 115 places. It made the biggest ""improvement"". Short-term ranking trends for Taiwan (2024 vs. 2023) Data source: Latest data released by Climate Trace in November 2025. If we disregard the rankings and only look at the emission reduction rates, more than half of them have achieved significant results. Among them, Linkou Power Plant won the title of carbon reduction champion last year with a reduction of 4.92%, followed closely by Heping Power Plant and China Power Plant. However, four companies saw an increase in carbon emissions: Taoyuan International Airport (+17.99%), China Steel Xiaogang Plant (+10.20%), Tongxiao Power Plant (+1.45%), and Datan Power Plant (+1.23%), with Taoyuan Airport experiencing the largest increase. Changes in emissions from Taiwan's top ten pollution sources in 2024 Data source: Latest data released by Climate Trace in November 2025. In the long run... If we extend the time frame, compared to 2021, most carbon emissions have decreased. Among the top 12 in Taiwan, the only two exceptions are Tongxiao Power Plant (+5.67%) and Formosa Plastics Mailiao Refinery (+4.23%). Dalin Power Plant is the long-term carbon reduction leader, with a reduction of 22.42% over four years; Datan Power Plant is second, with a reduction of 15.92% over four years; Taichung Power Plant, Linkou Power Plant, and Heping Power Plant also each achieved a reduction of nearly 11%. Taoyuan Airport cannot be compared due to the lack of 2021 data. In the long run, the company that improved its global ranking the most was Heping Power Plant, which dropped from 837th in global carbon pollution to outside the top 1,000, a drop of 232 places in four years, the largest decline. Zhonglong Steel followed closely behind, dropping 178 places in four years, from 834th to outside the top 1,000. The biggest riser was Formosa Plastics Mailiao Refinery, which climbed 43 places. It was also the only Taiwanese company among the top 12 in Taiwan to rise in the global ranking. However, compared to its peak in 2022, Formosa Plastics Mailiao Refinery's global ranking has dropped significantly (1467 → 1751), but there is still room for improvement. A comparison of the changes in Taiwan's top ten pollution sources over four years (2024 vs. 2021). Data source: Latest data released by Climate Trace in November 2025. Back in COP27, Andrew Zolli, impact manager at Planet Labs, a climate tracking partner and satellite company, told Protocol: ""We are moving toward an era of climate transparency."" At COP30, Climate Tracker not only aimed to make data transparent, but also proactively launched a new decarbonization roadmap , proposing potential solutions for all major global greenhouse gas emission sources. For example, it suggested that textile factories in Taoyuan switch to electric boilers and industrial heat pumps to reduce fuel emissions and improve energy efficiency; it suggested that the Bali landfill reduce waste through recycling, composting, or anaerobic digestion technologies and install biogas collection systems, and told you the expected emission reduction figures. Perhaps people's ""madness"" has made climate tracking realize that it can't just be a matter of taking stock and waiting for Godot, but must instead echo UN Secretary-General António Guterres's impassioned call at COP30: ""This is no longer the time for negotiation, but the time for implementation, implementation, and more implementation."" For Taiwanese industries, if the emissions reduction target is set at 173 million tons, Climate Trace has proposed 69 practical strategies, ranked by their emissions reduction potential. Solar power generation has the greatest potential for emissions reduction, potentially achieving 69.1% of the target. Pollution sources are ranked by difficulty, from simple to complex, allowing you to start with the less challenging options.

TWN,"Climate TRACE data are used to rank Taiwan’s major electricity generators, including Mailiao, Taichung, Hsing Ta, Linkou, and the Third Nuclear Power Plant, as part of national emissions discussions. The coverage focuses on source identification rather than on post‑publication actions.",Environmental Impact Assessment: Independent tracking of carbon emissions takes a leap forward,Taipei Times,"December 27, 2023","Thanks to a newly updated global database of greenhouse gas (GHG) sources and emissions, people around the world can now zoom in on their region, and see how much carbon dioxide power plants and industrial sites are sending into the atmosphere. For anyone concerned about climate change, the information is both engrossing and alarming.

Since its launch in July 2020, Climate TRACE has been identifying sources of GHGs and quantifying their emissions through a combination of satellite imagery, AI, and what its Web site (climatetrace.org) calls “ground truth” data. The last of these are typically measurements generated by on-site sensors that have been calibrated and verified by an independent entity, such as a government environmental-protection unit or an NGO. Around the world, relatively few GHG emitters gather such data; if they do, they don’t always share it. But Climate TRACE believes it’s accumulating enough trusted data to devise algorithms which can accurately predict emissions even in the absence of “ground truth” results.

According to a Dec. 3 article in Science, Climate TRACE was initially supported by personal donations from former US vice president Al Gore and others, and “does not accept corporate or government sponsorship.” However, a key source of funding has been Google.org, the charitable arm of Google.

EMISSIONS

Climate TRACE’s first set of results, published two years ago, gave estimates for 72,612 GHG sources. The datasets released at the start of this month, covering emissions last year, are vastly more comprehensive, encompassing 352 million sources across every sector. Among them are airports, agribusinesses, cement makers, coal mines, garbage incinerators and steelworks.

Across the planet, Climate TRACE provides data on 8,545 power stations. In terms of carbon dioxide pollution, Taichung Power Plant (台中發電廠) ranked number two in the world in 2021. Another coal-fired facility, Mailiao Power Plant (麥寮電廠) in Yunlin County, was number eight. They were number one and number nine, respectively, last year. For both, the Climate TRACE rates its data confidence as “medium” — but for very few industrial sites, even in the technologically advanced countries, is data confidence marked as “high” or “very high.”

Taiwan having a power station that emits more carbon dioxide than any other on Earth is a headline-grabbing fact, but not especially significant. Large coal-fired power plants are usually more efficient than small ones, so it makes sense to concentrate generating capacity.

By itself, Taichung Power Plant is responsible for more emissions — 32.7 MMT (million metric tons) of CO2 last year — than 133 of the 244 countries and non-sovereign territories for which Climate TRACE has collected data. Yet it accounts for just under 11 percent of Taiwan’s total carbon dioxide output, according to the NGO’s estimate for the country’s total emissions last year. And Climate TRACE’s calculations suggest there’s a considerable gap between the numbers announced by Taiwan’s government and actual emissions.

The NGO concluded that, in 2021, Taiwan was the source of 301.25 MMT of carbon dioxide. Their tally for last year is slightly lower at 293.45 MMT. Statistics from the Ministry of Economic Affairs’ Energy Administration show 2021 CO2 emissions totaling 267 MMT.

UNDERREPORTING

Climate TRACE’s figure for 2021 CO2e (which includes all GHGs, not just carbon dioxide, giving them weights according to how much they contribute to planetary warming) is 330.91 MMT. Yet the Climate Citizen Dialogue Platform (氣候公民對話平臺), a Web site belonging by the Ministry of Enviroment’s Climate Change Administration, put the nation’s GHG emissions in 2021 at 297 MMT CO2e in total, or 275 MMT net “after deducting carbon sinks.”

It isn’t clear if government calculations exclude certain sources, or if major polluters are underreporting.

Taiwan isn’t the only country which appears to undercount its GHG emissions. Climate TRACE says that China’s carbon dioxide emissions last year totaled 12,709 MMT, versus an official figure of 11,397 MMT. The United Arab Emirates, which hosted the recent COP28 climate summit, failed to report any methane emissions for almost a decade, The Guardian reported on Aug. 17. Methane, a potent GHG, is thought to be responsible for about a quarter of global warming.

A Sept. 28 Reuters report points out that, “Taiwan has by far the lowest share of clean electricity in its electricity mix of major economies in Asia.” And a review of Taiwan’s energy situation last year, published on March 25, by National Taiwan University’s Risk Society and Policy Research Center, notes that burning coal is still the country’s number-one method for generating power. The proportion of electricity produced this way declined from 46.11 percent in 2019 to 42.07 percent last year, so there’s been progress — but no one can accuse Taiwan of reckless speed when it comes to phasing out this hideously polluting fossil fuel (see “Environmental Impact Assessment: Can Taiwan kick its coal habit?” in the March 23, 2022 Taipei Times).

In the most recent Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), published at the COP28 summit, Taiwan was ranked 61st out of 64 economies, a fall of four places compared to last year. The country scored relatively well for climate policy, but poorly in the categories of GHG emissions, renewables and energy use. Acknowledging that Taiwan is not a signatory of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, yet seeks constructive participation, the experts who drew up the CCPI demanded an end to fossil fuel subsidies.

Among Climate TRACE’s findings, there’s additional evidence that, when it comes to decarbonizing the economy, Taiwan is moving slowly by international standards.

The Taichung Power Plant last year pumped 2.7 percent less CO2 into the atmosphere compared to the previous year, yet in a ranking of the world’s most carbon-emitting sites, it rose from 34th place to 28th. Mailiao Power Plant achieved a similar cut in emissions, but climbed from 62nd position to 55th. Hsinta Power Plant (興達發電廠) in Kaohsiung, which also produced less pollution last year, moved up 14 places in the ranking, to 140th. This year, Hsinta Power Plant has conducted test firings of coal-hydrogen mixtures to reduce its dependence on coal.

Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), which owns Mailiao Power Plant, plans to convert the plant into one that burns liquified natural gas (LNG) instead of coal. This could happen as soon as 2028.

Taiwan’s two main petrochemical plants recorded impressive reductions in CO2e emissions between 2021 and 2022. The FPG complex at Mailiao (麥寮) emitted 4.874 MMT last year, down from 6.082 MMT — yet it remains the most polluting of the 116 petrochemical facilities around the world monitored by Climate TRACE. The CPC Corporation, Taiwan complex at Linyuan (林園) in Kaohsiung, where annual emissions fell from 2.28 MMT to 1.827 MMT, dropped from 16th in the global rankings to 23rd.

FPG’s 2020 global carbon footprint was 51.83 MMT, greater than that of Switzerland. Like other polluters, it’s under pressure to reduce emissions as international brands seek to decarbonize their supply chains. Climate TRACE has introduced a level of detail and transparency to the process that should accelerate progress.

A Dec. 3 press release by Climate TRACE says that they’ve started collaborating with electric vehicle makers Tesla and Polestar “to enhance their emissions data on steel and aluminum suppliers.” Boeing has also committed to work with Climate TRACE.

For ordinary citizens, it’s a valuable tool for judging whether companies and governments are taking the fight against climate change seriously, and whether the data they share can be trusted.

Environmental groups and members of the public held a rally outside the Legislative Yuan today to call on both parties to pass the resolution and implement the national carbon reduction goals. Kuomintang legislator Lo Ting-wei, Taiwan People's Party legislator Chang Chi-kai, and others recently proposed a resolution in the Legislative Yuan to achieve the national carbon reduction target of eliminating coal-fired power plants by 2028. The Taiwan Healthy Air Action Alliance, the Changhua County Medical Community Alliance, and other groups expressed their support for this demand today in front of the Legislative Yuan's Qunxian Building. Chang Chi-kai, who attended the meeting, said that after the decommissioning of Unit 2 of the Third Nuclear Power Plant this year, all the power plants in Taiwan are operating at full capacity, and even the backup coal-fired units have been put into operation for emergency repairs. Tomorrow, the main resolution on coal-free Taichung Power Plant by 2028 must be passed, and the government will be required to propose how much coal consumption should be reduced by the Taichung Power Plant each year. Speaking at the event, Luo Tingwei stated that achieving a coal-free Taichung power plant by 2028 is absolutely achievable. He emphasized that the main resolution aims to help industries develop while also considering the health of the people, rather than hindering progress or implementing retaliatory policies. Yeh Kuang-peng, founding chairman of the Taiwan Healthy Air Action Alliance, stated that according to the Climate Trace 2023 report, the Taichung Power Plant has the highest carbon emissions among more than 8,000 power plants worldwide. This year and next year, two units of the Taichung Power Plant's Phase I gas-fired power plant, with a total installed capacity of 26 million kilowatts, will be put into operation, yet the plant will not reduce its coal consumption by even one ton. He urged the central government to assume corresponding governance responsibilities if it has the authority to do so. Yueh Hsiang-wen, the executive of the Taichung City Alliance for Better Gas, said that according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' National Electricity Supply and Demand Report, even taking into account the power shortfall from the phase-out of nuclear power, by 2028, the newly added gas-fired power plants nationwide will be able to completely replace the total power generation of existing coal-fired plants. It is absolutely feasible for Taichung Power Plant to be coal-free by 2028. Environmental groups also called on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus to allow DPP legislators to cast their votes in accordance with the will of the people in their constituencies tomorrow, in order to inspire public sentiment across the country.",https://money.udn.com/money/story/7307/8779415
THA,"Climate TRACE data identify the Mae Moh coal‑fired power plant in Lampang province, operated by EGAT, as Thailand’s largest CO₂‑emitting project, linking its emissions to regional air‑quality impacts in Lampang, Phayao, Nan, and Phrae. Follow‑on actions described include delayed decommissioning of specific coal units and installation of pollution‑control upgrades, alongside continued community concern.",Anguish for residents as Thailand’s most polluting coal plant gets new lease of life,Mongabay and Recessary,"October 1, 2025","Thailand has announced it will delay the decommissioning of several coal-fired units at the 2,400-megawatt Mae Moh power plant in Lampang province, prompting fears among communities who have dealt with health problems linked to the plant for decades. The Aug. 21 announcement, made by the National Energy Policy Committee, also undermines pledges by the government to address the swirling air pollution crisis in the country. Units 8 and 11 of the Mae Moh power plant, in Mae Moh district, were due to be retired at the end of 2025. But now both will remain functioning until 2031, while units 12 and 13 will be refurbished and operate until 2048 — just two years before the entire plant is due to shut down. The decision to extend the lifespan of units in Mae Moh is part of Thailand’s bid to reduce reliance on fuel imports and keep energy costs down. But as the nation struggles to rein in air pollution that is estimated to kill between 25,432 and 32,200 people annually — a figure that hits 8.1 million globally — the decision also marks a continued dependence on burning coal. Although coal only made up 16.7% of Thailand’s energy mix in 2024, fossil fuels as a whole made up 85%, while wind and solar contributed just 5% of the estimated 199.5 terawatt-hours generated in 2024. Coal-fired plants like the one in Mae Moh give Thailand access to cheap power, but they’re also responsible for contaminating the air and water with a mix of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxides like nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), mercury, lead and other heavy metals, along with dangerous particulates, leading to cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological disorders, as well as cancer and premature death. UNICEF warned in January that the health of 13.6 million children is at risk as exposure to air pollution continues to rise across Thailand. Yet Thailand’s Draft Clean Air Act, which would guarantee Thais the right to clean air and introduce regulatory tools to combat emissions across polluting sectors, continues to languish in parliament amid political upheaval and conflict along the border with Cambodia. Mae Moh power plant, owned and operated by the state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), is ranked by Climate Trace as Thailand’s largest CO2 polluting project out of 54 projects assessed across 10 sectors, producing the equivalent of 14.81 million metric tons of CO2 each year over a 20-year Global Warming Potential time frame. That’s more than double the second-worst polluting power plant listed, and more than the emissions produced by both Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi and Don Muang international airports combined. Data from the European Union’s Copernicus browser, which provides atmospheric satellite analysis of air composition, shows that between mid-January and the end of March, high levels of concentrated NO2 pollution surrounding the Mae Moh power plant spread more than 18,500 square kilometers (7,140 square miles) across the Thai provinces of Lampang, Phayao, Nan and Phrae, although NO2 pollution of a lower concentration also spread much farther afield. The decision to extend the lifespan of two of Mae Moh’s units may run counter to Thailand’s emissions reduction commitment under the Paris climate agreement, also known as its nationally determined contribution (NDC). Thailand is due to submit its latest version, NDC 3.0, to the U.N. later this year, and it’s expected to include a set date for phasing out coal. The country’s previous NDC 2.0 plan was deemed “critically insufficient” by Climate Action Tracker when it was submitted in 2022. “For me, it’s almost like being thrown back into the past,” said Tara Buakamsri of Climate Connectors, an advocacy research group focused on environmental justice in Thailand. “I mean, if we’re talking about a just transition and creating a balance between the interests of the national utility like [the Mae Moh power plant] and a future-oriented national energy policy, shouldn’t there be other ways that don’t involve extending the coal phaseout or locking us into gas? And what about the new NDC 3.0 and net-zero targets — will we actually meet them, and if so, how?” EGAT has, according to its website, installed devices at Mae Moh to reduce dust from the burning of coal, and upgraded units 8-13 and the replacement for unit 1 to reduce SO2 pollution by a reported 95-97%. It also says there’s other technology in place to address nitrogen oxide pollution. However, EGAT’s own data show that the Mae Moh coal plant is still emitting more SO2, nitrogen oxides and PM2.5 — particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter — than any other power plant in the country assessed by EGAT. While Buakamsri noted that some units at Mae Moh have, according to EGAT, been upgraded to reduce various emissions, he pointed out that Thailand doesn’t have smokestack emissions standards for mercury, and that a 2018 estimate from Greenpeace suggested that Mae Moh power plant releases 1,618.1 kilograms of mercury into the atmosphere each year. Thai academics estimated in 2020 that the plant was churning out 5.22-9.20 micrograms of mercury vapor per cubic meter. That’s well in excess of what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency deems the minimal risk level for mercury vapor is, at 0.2 µg/m3, and threshold limit value (a time weighted average for an eight-hour day), at 25 µg/m3. The mercury emissions from Mae Moh spread out across Lampang province, contributing to the broader problem of air pollution that has engulfed northern Thailand, where industrial estates, the growing number of vehicles, and the burning of biomass are rendering the air deadly, especially during the spring burning season. “It not only contributed to local air pollution but also transboundary one,” Buakamsri said. Poisoned for power According to EGAT, the Mae Moh power plant, along with the adjoining mine that supplies the plant with lignite — a low-grade form of coal — are both due to be shut down by 2050. However, local officials and Mae Moh residents told Mongabay they remain skeptical of EGAT’s claims and fear that profits and power generation will take precedence over human health and environmental protection. “I’m not sure I’ll still be alive by 2050, I doubt whoever made that announcement at EGAT will still be alive — and only the people who are will know whether EGAT keeps its promise,” said Maliwan Nakwiroj, who goes by the nickname Joom and has lived for many years in close proximity to the plant. Joom previously spoke with Mongabay about her community’s long fight with EGAT over health issues linked to pollution from the Mae Moh power plant and lignite mine. It began in the 1950s with the opening of the mine, which once covered 13,000 hectares (about 32,100 acres) and today spans nearly 4,000 hectares (nearly 10,000 acres). This was followed by the opening of the first coal-fired generator in 1978, with 12 more units built between 1979 and 2019. The first three units were retired in 2000, but the plant remains significant for Thailand’s energy production. In 2021, the plant supplied 50% of all electricity in northern Thailand, 30% to the central region, and 20% to the northeast. Mae Moh’s eight remaining operational units use what the industry calls subcritical technology — capable of converting roughly 33-37% of coal it burns into energy. Newer plants run more the efficient “supercritical” systems, but a 2019 Australia Institute study found that even these still produce more emissions than most other sources of energy — especially when “brown coal” like lignite is burned. Since the Mae Moh plant began running, residents have been locked into a decades-long dispute with EGAT over relocation away from the pollution and compensation for the myriad health issues experienced by those living in the surrounding area. For years, EGAT denied that pollution from either the lignite mine or the coal plant were directly responsible for the respiratory illnesses that were ravaging nearby communities, even appealing a 2009 ruling by the Chiang Mai Administrative Court that found the state-owned utility needed to relocate communities living within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of the projects due to the pollution and health hazards, as well as pay compensation for health care and lost livelihoods. The case eventually came before Thailand’s Supreme Court in 2015, which upheld the lower court’s verdict and added more interest to the compensation owed to local residents. By then, however, more than 30 plaintiffs had died of their illnesses. For those who lived, the compensation didn’t cover the health costs associated with their conditions. “EGAT wanted to show the world that the way they mined was clean, that it wasn’t dangerous,” Joom said. “We needed to prove the health problems were linked to the power plant and the mine, but local doctors told us these were just common problems, so NGOs helped put us in touch with specialist doctors in Bangkok — about 130 people from 16 affected villages were randomly chosen to get tested.” Multiple tests, X-rays, blood and urine samples confirmed the community’s suspicions: that the chemicals in Mae Moh’s air were to blame. All 130 villagers tested were found to have pneumoconiosis, or scarring of the lungs, caused by prolonged exposure to coal dust, SO2 and NO2. “The plant and mine still operate today because it provides many benefits to the government, but to this day, there are around 45 villages — some 40,000 people — who live with the problems they’ve created,” Joom said. “I say to EGAT, if you think our water is clean, then drink it, eat the fish that smell so bad, we won’t touch them.” Joom also raised suspicions about a new railway project that aims to connect the Thai provinces of Phrae, Phayao, Lampang and Chiang Rai to Laos’s Bokeo province, serving both tourism and goods shipment services. This, she said, could allow coal imports to sustain the power plant long after the Mae Moh lignite mine is exhausted; the plant is expected to continue operating until 2049. Data from the Department of Mineral Resources and the State Railway of Thailand show that the Den Chai–Chiang Rai–Chiang Khong dual-track railway will greatly improve connectivity between provinces that, collectively, contain Thailand’s largest reserves of lignite. Compounding these fears is EGAT’s previous deals with the State Railway of Thailand to promote tourism around the lignite mine. Mongabay made multiple attempts to contact EGAT, by phone, email and by delivering detailed questions in a letter to the utility’s head office in Bangkok. But as of the time of writing, there has been no reply. ‘I’ll have trouble breathing for the rest of my life’ Skepticism over whether EGAT will actually shut down the Mae Moh operation by 2050 is widespread across the district. And with more than 24 years left to run, local officials are demanding EGAT do more to mitigate their project’s pollution and safeguard the future of the local economy. “We know the plan to close the plant in 2050, but EGAT has betrayed us before, so the 2050 closure is hard to believe,” Sunisa Thiyu, deputy mayor of Sop Pad subdistrict administrative organization in Mae Moh district, told Mongabay in her office overlooking the Mae Moh power plant. “I think that EGAT is seeking new sources of coal, they’ve surveyed our community’s lands, it’s possible that they’ll try to evict us, but we’ve learned from our long, painful history — my own father died here from emphysema, I have issues with asthma, so we will resist EGAT.” There are dual fears: that EGAT may prolong its exit from Mae Moh; and that when it does leave, it will do so without cleaning up the environmental damage or helping retrain and care for the health of the community members who have kept the plant and the mine running. “The livelihoods of our community have totally changed,” Thiyu said. “Before, we worked in agriculture, but EGAT blocked access to much of the land. Then the dust from the mine, the air pollution from the power plant, it gets into everything — rice doesn’t grow well, vegetables farmed here make people sick, we lost many freshwater species — but EGAT told us that water and air contamination hadn’t reached unsafe levels, even though our water sources have been swallowed up by the sediment pond of the power plant and smell so bad, it keeps us up at night.” The filtration upgrades to the power plant are, to Thiyu, merely an excuse to keep burning coal. But EGAT’s presence in their community is now so entrenched that if the mine and power plant were to close, Lampang’s provincial gross domestic product would drop by an estimated 17%, Ketsirin Paengsen, the head of the Mae Moh Smart City project, which aims to develop a sustainable, renewables-led economy after the coal plant closes, said last year. Thiyu estimated that roughly 2,000 local residents have jobs at the power plant, while researchers in 2024 estimated 9,000 jobs were created by coal mining operations in Mae Moh, some 47% of the district’s population. One former worker at the power plant for more than a decade told Mongabay that despite the personal protective equipment provided, they — and almost all other workers they knew — grew sick. “Most stay silent, because they need the salary, but we all developed respiratory issues working at the power plant,” said the former employee, who requested anonymity over fears their family could be blacklisted from working for EGAT. “My doctor told me that I’ll have trouble breathing for the rest of my life. My throat hurts a lot, but for others it was worse — some got cancer and died.” Mongabay was unable to verify whether cases of cancer among power plant employees were directly related to their jobs. According to Thiyu, their protests against EGAT helped to secure the opening of a small hospital in Mae Moh (it’s unclear what EGAT’s role was), but the services remain limited due to a shortage of specialist staff. Many residents with respiratory illnesses are still referred to larger hospitals in Lampang or Chiang Mai. Few can afford the long-term care needed for the ailments they’ve acquired. The needle may be moving in favor of renewables, but data from global energy think tank Ember show progress has been remarkably slow — particular when compared regionally. Thailand’s wind power generating capacity in 2013 was 300 megawatts, but had only grown to 3,600 MW by 2024, more than a decade later. Similarly, solar — for which Thailand has great potential — has only increased from 100 MW in 2011 to 6,100 MW in 2024. Vietnam, by contrast, saw wind power capacity jump from 500 MW in 2018 to 12,300 MW in 2024 while solar leapt from just 4,800 MW in 2019 to 25,900 MW in 2024. EGAT is also in the process of constructing a 38.5 MW solar farm in Mae Moh, which it has said will be used to power the lignite mining activities, not for commercial purposes. According to Thiyu, this too was opposed by the community because it meant losing more land, instead of EGAT building atop rehabilitated mining land. When Mongabay attempted to visit the solar farm, EGAT staff denied reporters and Thiyu entry. But for all of EGAT’s efforts, there remains little faith among those who’ve lived with the impacts the Mae Moh project has brought about, even as air pollution garners more attention in Thai politics and among the public. “I feel like Thai people still aren’t fully aware of the danger posed by air pollution — few outside of Mae Moh know our story,” Joom said. “Whenever air pollution is discussed, like during burning season, everyone just blames the farmers — why not come here and blame EGAT? Burning season’s once a year, but the power plant is polluting our air all day every day.”",https://news.mongabay.com/2025/10/anguish-for-residents-as-thailands-most-polluting-coal-plant-gets-new-lease-of-life/
TUR,"Climate TRACE data are used to attribute Çanakkale’s emissions primarily to coal power plants in Biga and Çan, naming facilities operated by İÇDAŞ, Cenal, the 18 Mart plant, and the Çan2 plant owned by ODAŞ. The articles frame a concentrated industrial‑source problem without documenting subsequent regulatory or enforcement actions.",Thermal Power Plants Threaten Life in Çanakkale,canakkaleaynalipazar.com,"August 5, 2025","Five thermal power plants have made Çanakkale the most polluted city in Türkiye. The state is simply watching as the pollution caused by fossil fuels continues. Çanakkale ranks 4th in Türkiye in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. It is the city with the highest carbon emissions from electricity generation. Documents reveal that the 5 thermal power plants located in Biga and Çan pose a threat to human life. The report highlights that the government has no measures or plans in place to reduce carbon emissions from electricity production. CARBON REPORT REVEALS THE HARSH TRUTH. The Turkish Economic Policy Research Foundation (TEPAV) prepared a report in July titled ""Türkiye's Emission Map: Spatial and Sectoral Distribution - What Does it Tell Us About the New Law?"". Türkiye's first climate law, the ""Climate Law,"" was passed by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on July 3, 2025, and entered into force. The law covers the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation activities, planning and implementation tools, revenues, permits and controls, and the procedures and principles of the legal and institutional framework related to these, all of which are essential in the fight against climate change. Whether the law, prepared in good faith, will be implemented or shelved due to pressure from capitalist circles is unknown. However, as discussions on the law began, think tanks prepared and shared reports on Türkiye's emission map and the causes and consequences of air pollution with the public. One of these think tanks is the Turkish Economic Policy Research Foundation (TEPAV), established by businesspeople, bureaucrats, and academics. Under the leadership of Mühdan Sağlam, director of the Energy and Climate Change Studies Center, researchers Sercan Sevgili and M. Can Torun prepared a report titled ""Türkiye's Emission Map: Spatial and Sectoral Distribution - What Does it Tell Us About the New Law?"". The report identifies Türkiye's highest carbon emission-producing facilities and the provinces experiencing the most pollution. ÇANAKKALE RANKS AFTER THE 3 LARGEST METROPOLITAN CITIES IN CARBON EMISSIONS! According to a report that includes data from Climate Trace, which monitors atmospheric carbon emissions in real time, Istanbul alone accounts for approximately 9% of Türkiye's total carbon emissions. The report states that Istanbul is followed by Izmir, Ankara, Canakkale, Zonguldak, and Hatay, all of which have high emission levels. ÇANAKKALE ALSO LEADS IN GREENHOUSE GAS AND CARBON EMISSIONS! An examination of the sectoral composition of the five provinces with the highest total greenhouse gas emissions revealed that Istanbul, Izmir, Ankara, Canakkale, and Zonguldak stood out. It is noteworthy that Canakkale ranks after Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir in both carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. EMISSIONS ARE HIGH IN ÇANAKKALE DUE TO ELECTRICITY GENERATION! The report details how emissions in Çanakkale and Zonguldak provinces largely originate from electricity generation. It highlights that pollution from two thermal power plants belonging to İÇDAŞ, one belonging to Cenal, the 18 Mart plant in Çan, and the Çan2 thermal power plant belonging to ODAŞ results in 20.386 million tons of emissions annually in Çanakkale and 18.154 million tons in Zonguldak, accounting for approximately 80% of total emissions in both provinces. POLLUTION FROM ELECTRICITY GENERATION PUTS ÇANAKKALE IN THE SPOTLIGHT! The TEPAV report highlighted that Çanakkale and Zonguldak provinces, which rank among the top five in total carbon emissions in Turkey, share a similar profile in terms of sectoral composition. It noted that in both provinces, the electricity generation sector is by far the highest source of emissions. THERMAL POWER PLANTS IN ÇANAKKALE ACCOUNT FOR 74% OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS! The report states that total greenhouse gas emissions in Çanakkale amount to 27,381,087 tons of CO₂e; 20,336,000 tons of this is attributed to electricity generation, representing approximately 74% of total emissions. The report identifies electricity production as the primary source of pollution, followed by coal mining (1,415,000 tons), international shipping (1,268,000 tons), solid waste disposal (1,053,000 tons), the cement industry (680,000 tons), and road transportation (649,000 tons). CANAKKALE IS FIRST ON THE LIST! According to the TEPAV report, when examining the distribution of greenhouse gas emissions across Turkey by type of activity, electricity generation activities in Çanakkale rank first, causing a total of 20.336 million tons of CO₂e in emissions. The report also noted that carbon emissions from electricity generation stand out as a central problem, particularly in provinces where fossil fuel-based production still forms the backbone of the energy system (Çanakkale: 20.386 million tons, Zonguldak: 18.113 million tons, Adana: 16.411 million tons). Despite this, the law does not include region-based targets or transition programs for decarbonizing electricity generation infrastructure. The report also noted that ""Spatial analyses clearly show that greenhouse gas emissions in Türkiye are concentrated not only sectorally but also spatially. Istanbul alone accounts for 9% of total emissions with 61 million tons of CO₂e, followed by provinces such as Izmir, Ankara, Canakkale, and Zonguldak."" THE HIGHEST CARBON EMISSIONS ARE OCCURRING IN ÇANAKKALE AND ZONGULDAK! The analyses conducted specifically on the provinces of Zonguldak and Çanakkale in the TEPAV report offer striking insights into how a just transition should be addressed at the local level. According to Climate Trace data, Çanakkale and Zonguldak, among the top five provinces in Türkiye with the highest carbon emissions, collectively produced approximately 54 million tons (Zonguldak: 27,188,537 tons; Çanakkale: 27,381,087 tons) of carbon equivalent emissions; almost all of these emissions originate from fossil fuel-based electricity generation facilities. ""THERE IS A NEED FOR SECTORAL TRANSFORMATION PLANNING POLICIES."" The report details how emissions from electricity generation constitute a large portion of total emissions in Çanakkale. Regarding electricity generation facilities that cause air pollution, the report states: “Unlike provinces where carbon compositions are spread across numerous sectors such as industry, transportation, or housing, Çanakkale's carbon composition is quite centralized. Therefore, provinces like Çanakkale and Zonguldak, where carbon intensities are concentrated in specific sectors, require special just transition policies that include sectoral transformation plans, local economic restructuring models, job compensation programs, and training and reskilling strategies.” ""THE ENERGY SECTOR NEEDS SPECIAL TRANSFORMATION PLANS."" For example, in provinces like Zonguldak and Çanakkale, emissions from electricity generation account for nearly 80% of the total, and energy sector-specific transformation plans are necessary. In cities like Istanbul, emissions are spread across a much wider range of activities, including transportation, housing, waste, and international aviation. This situation necessitates multi-sectoral integrated urban planning. The conclusion section of the report states that Çanakkale, which is the most polluted city due to coal-fired thermal power plants used for electricity generation, is assessed as follows: ""It has been concluded that Çanakkale ranks highly due to its sectoral concentration.""",https://www.canakkaleaynalipazar.com/haber-termik-santraller-canakkalede-yasami-tehdit-ediyor-26429.html
USA,"Climate TRACE data are used to identify PM2.5 super‑emitting facilities on Long Island, including the Holtsville, Northport, and Wading River/Shoreham power plants, as well as vessel emissions from Port Jefferson and Greenport harbors. Follow‑on actions described include statements from National Grid about operational impacts of federal standards and references to state monitoring sites used to contextualize pollution levels.",Shelter Island Reporter Editorial: The air we breathe,Shelter Island Reporter and Riverhead News-Review,"December 7, 2025","An international group of nonprofits under the banner of Climate Trace, which tracks greenhouse gas around the world, has found that there are five “super emitters” on Long Island, which put into our air “particulate matter.” These toxic particles come to us through the air due to the burning of fossil fuels for power, among other sources, and can cause serious diseases. Researchers at Stony Brook University say this form of pollution causes 100,000 U.S. deaths a year. Climate Trace says the super emitters on Long Island are power plants in Holtsville, Shoreham/Wading River, Northport, and two harbors, Port Jefferson and Greenport. According to Newsday, “The figures for the two harbors are calculated by adding emissions from ferries and other boats that come and go from that port, Climate Trace explained: ‘Frequent domestic vessel traffic can also contribute significantly.’” Cause for alarm? Steps to be taken? No way, says the Environmental Protection Agency led by former East End congressman Lee Zeldin. In fact, all this stuff is, according to President Trump, Mr. Zeldin’s boss, “a scam.” Last March, Mr. Zeldin laid plans to reverse multiple regulations protecting us from carbon in the air we breathe, and protections to keep the water we drink clean. Mr. Zeldin has been quoted saying, “We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.” Religion? Or a scam? Or the truth Big Oil and Big Coal don’t want you to hear? As we’ve said before in this space, it’s baffling that there are still people who deny that climate change and severe weather patterns are chiefly caused by the burning of fossil fuels that erode the planet’s atmospheric shield, something documented by an overwhelming consensus of scientists and scientific organizations. Disbelieving the evidence is on par with the belief that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Mr. Zeldin, when he represented the East End, was in the main a moderate. But now he’s had a road to Damascus conversion, completely on board with the administration. As The New York Times reported: “Mr. Zeldin has withheld billions of dollars in climate funds approved by Congress, tried to fire hundreds of employees, recommended the elimination of thousands more E.P.A. scientists, and started trying to repeal dozens of environmental regulations that limit toxic pollution. He has filled the leadership ranks at the agency with lobbyists and lawyers from industries that have fought environmental regulations.” What is to be done? One place to start is to listen to the environmentalist and clean-energy advocate Robert Swan, who said, “The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.”",https://shelterislandreporter.timesreview.com/2025/12/07/shelter-island-reporter-editorial-the-air-we-breathe/

Follow‑on actions described include statements from National Grid about operational impacts of federal standards and references to state monitoring sites used to contextualize pollution levels.","EPA prepares to roll back air pollution standard, as Lee Zeldin remakes agency",Newsday,"November 24, 2025","In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin rolled out plans to overturn 31 environmental regulations aimed at curbing carbon emissions and protecting clean air and water, as part of a dramatic remaking of the agency. ""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion,"" Zeldin said at the time, saying the effort would save ""trillions in regulatory costs."" Among the regulations Zeldin said he would reconsider is an air quality standard established last year under President Joe Biden. By the end of the fall, according to an Environmental Protection Agency legal motion, Zeldin will propose a new, looser health standard for fine particulate matter — a byproduct of burning fossil fuels, wildfires and some manufacturing that has been linked to lung, heart and neurological diseases. The agency plans to finalize the rule by February, the motion said. While Long Island's air quality meets the current federal standard, there are significant local sources that emit particulate matter — tiny motes of dust, soot and chemicals. Additionally, pollution from the Midwest and South drifts across Long Island. Relaxing the standard could impair air quality, both on Long Island and nationally, which would lead to an increase in health problems and premature deaths, public health experts said. Most health organizations, including the American Lung Association, the American Thoracic Society and the World Health Organization, have argued for even tighter standards. ""This health standard was an important recognition that the science shows an unacceptable number of people are dying from this pollution,"" said John Walke, director of federal clean air at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The impending rollback, he fears, ""will just flatly contradict the medical science about how dangerous this pollution is."" In announcing his plan for a less stringent rule for fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, Zeldin, a former Republican congressman from Shirley, said the existing standard would ""shut down opportunities for American manufacturing and small businesses."" ""The Trump EPA believes that protecting human health and the environment and ensuring that we do not shut down America's industrial base, does not need to be a binary choice,"" the EPA said in an emailed statement to Newsday. The agency did not respond to questions about how the present limit hinders industry. Several business groups, including those representing home builders, farmers and developers, welcomed the rollback of regulations, saying it would reduce burdens on their businesses and help lower costs for consumers. Marty Durbin, senior vice president of policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement the group supported a more balanced approach to regulation that would ""support greater economic growth."" ""American businesses were crippled with an unprecedented regulatory onslaught during the previous administration that contributed to higher costs felt by families around the country,"" he said. American Petroleum Institute president Mike Sommers said in a statement he was pleased to see the Trump administration furthering many of the group's policy priorities, which will ""advance American energy dominance"" and reduce dependence on foreign energy sources. Critics, however, said the expected reversal on particle pollution is one of dozens of rollbacks under Zeldin that will cause serious harm to the planet's natural places and its climate. Zeldin has laid out a plan to repeal the legal foundation for regulating greenhouse gases, known as the endangerment finding. He has terminated hundreds of grants for mitigating pollution in low-income communities, ended oversight of methane emissions from oil and gas facilities and invited coal- and oil-burning power plants to apply for exemptions from limits on mercury pollution. He also has eliminated the agency’s scientific research branch and is on track to cut roughly a third of EPA jobs overall by the end of the year. Last week, the EPA proposed to rescind federal protection from millions of acres of wetlands and several measures to weaken the Endangered Species Act, moves applauded by groups representing developers, ranchers and the mining and fossil fuel industries. Local and not-so-local sources Once airborne, particulate matter can travel thousands of miles. Prevailing winds carry it from wildfires in Canadian forests, as Long Islanders discovered two summers ago, when the air was thick with an orange haze, and from coal plants in the South and Midwest. ""New York doesn't have the coal-fired power plants that you see in Indiana and Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky. But you're getting all their pollution,"" Walke said. And there are significant local sources as well. Long Island’s power plants and incinerators, vehicles on its heavily trafficked highways and ships in seaside harbors all emit fine particle pollution. Climate Trace, an international coalition of nonprofits and scientists that tracks particle emissions worldwide, has identified five ""super emitters"" on Long Island. These five facilities are in the top 10% of particle polluters among the 660 million sources across the globe for which they’ve compiled data: the Holtsville power plant (103.28 tons of PM2.5 in 2024), Port Jefferson Harbor (87.9 tons), Wading River/Shoreham power plant (74.07 tons), Northport electricity plant (68.76 tons) and topping the list, Greenport Harbor (117.68 tons of PM 2.5). The figures for the two harbors are calculated by adding emissions from ferries and other boats that come and go from that port, Climate Trace explained: ""Frequent domestic vessel traffic can also contribute significantly."" ""Long Island, where our power plants reside, is in compliance with the current PM2.5 air quality standard measured by the NYSDEC,"" Molly Gilson, a spokesperson for National Grid, which owns the three power plants, wrote in an email to Newsday. ""Any relaxation of the standard would not result in any change of our operations."" Data collected from the state Department of Environmental Conservation’s monitoring sites — at Babylon, Holtsville and Eisenhower Park — show the annual averages for 2022 through 2024 varied between 5.5 and 7.8 micrograms per cubic meter, below the new federal standard. If the data showed the pollutant exceeded the federal standard, the state would be required to develop a plan to come into compliance ""as quickly as possible,"" a spokesperson for the DEC wrote in an email to Newsday. Federal limits on particle pollution have been progressively tightened over the past 30 years, as evidence accumulated that chronic exposure even at low levels increases the risk of respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological disease, among other health problems. Stronger regulations have led to significantly cleaner air across the United States and on Long Island, according to Loren Dempsey, an assistant professor of nursing at Molloy University who works with adolescents with lung disorders. And that has led to better lung health: Dempsey said asthma hospitalizations have dropped as air quality has improved. But Dempsey warned that more frequent and more intense wildfires — driven by climate change — have begun to reverse these gains. ""We need stronger protections, not less protection, right now,"" she said. Medical research prompted tightened standard Particulate matter is regulated under the Clean Air Act, which requires the EPA to set limits for any pollutant that ""may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare."" The standard governs ambient air, not emissions from individual facilities, and is intended to limit particle pollution to a level that is safe to breathe. Thirty years ago, the health standard for PM2.5 was set at 15 micrograms per cubic meter — the limit for the pollutant measured in ambient air — averaged over the course of a year. For a 24-hour period, the limit was set at 65 micrograms per cubic meter. Since then, the standard has been tightened several times, and those regulations have had tangible results: Since 2000, annual PM2.5 emissions nationwide have decreased by 37%, according to EPA data. Recent research has suggested that the standard was still too high. Scientists once believed that at very low levels, ""PM2.5 is not really toxic anymore,"" said Minghao Qiu, an assistant professor at Stony Brook University’s public health program. ""But increasingly research is showing that's not the case."" Last year, after considering three possible annual standards — 10, 9 and 8 micrograms per cubic meter — the EPA chose the middle path, lowering the annual health standard from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA's analysis concluded that the new standard would prevent 3,200 to 5,700 deaths per year beginning in 2032, when states would be expected to come into compliance. Dozens of industry groups, including the American Petroleum Institute, the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Chemistry Council, argued the new standard ""would risk jobs and livelihoods by making it even more difficult to obtain permits for new factories, facilities and infrastructure to power economic growth"" and filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the rule. Representatives for those groups didn't respond to requests for comment. Zeldin, who has maintained that the agency can protect the environment while easing regulations, has said the EPA's actions, including on particle pollution, would ""undo red tape"" and reduce costs. But those concerns, according to Walke, are not proper legal considerations in creating federal health standards. A unanimous 2001 Supreme Court decision ruled that the Clean Air Act ""unambiguously bars cost considerations from the [air quality standard]-setting process,"" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his opinion for the court. Any rollback Zeldin may propose would have to go through the same extensive rulemaking process that led to the tightened standard last year. Laura Kate Bender, head of public policy at the American Lung Association, said it will be hard for the EPA to argue that a looser standard would be equally protective of public health. ""There is no way that particle pollution is somehow less harmful than was thought previously,"" she said.
 ""These standards under the Clean Air Act have dramatically reduced levels of these common outdoor air pollutants, and made people healthier as a result. ... The challenge is that there's still work to do.""",https://www.newsday.com/long-island/environment/epa-regulations-particulate-v143mh1y

A new tool from a nonprofit climate coalition spearheaded by former Vice President Al Gore aims to help Louisiana residents see how the invisible threat travels — and who’s most at risk. Introduced at New York Climate Week in late September, Climate TRACE is a new website that aims to show an inventory of emissions. The tool models the spread of particulate matter, tiny particles that can lead to heart and lung problems as well as premature death when inhaled. On a given day, the map uses thousands of dots to show how the pollutants disperse into the air from facilities and into nearby communities. The tool also shows how much the same facilities contribute to human-caused climate change, as both the pollution and greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuels. “The connection between the climate crisis and the public health crisis driven by particulate pollution from the burning of fossil fuels to make petrochemicals, power transportation or generate power has not often received adequate attention,” Gore said in an interview. Gore teased the release of the tool at an August event in St. James Parish. His group first developed it to depict how pollution travels in Louisiana’s 85-mile-long petrochemical corridor along the Mississippi River, nicknamed “Cancer Alley.” After working with groups in the region, Gore said he was shocked by how severe health problems had become for local residents. Then, his group decided to expand the project. “When we succeeded in visualizing the particulate pollution in Cancer Alley, it became apparent that this was something we should do all over the country and the world,” Gore said. He said he hoped the new data and modeling will help community groups make their case to local officials and hold companies accountable. “There could be some companies that want to swap out their supply chains so that they are not contributing to the disease burden in communities like the River Parishes,” Gore said. Climate TRACE is already working with some subnational governments, business leaders and other organizations to choose suppliers with lower emissions, Gore said. The tool itself was developed by Carnegie Mellon University’s CREATE Lab, combining pollution and weather datasets to model the plumes of particulate matter as the prevailing wind changes. It also uses satellite data and remote sensing to more accurately track greenhouse gas emissions. Amy Gottsegen with the CREATE lab said Climate TRACE is a much larger, global version of plume modeling her lab creates for the Pittsburgh area each day to help people reduce their exposure to bad air quality. She noted the tool is limited by the data available. For example, facilities don’t report how much particulate matter they emit each day, so the team uses monthly data to create a daily average. They’ve also estimated what pollution plumes look like on days with the greatest emissions. The visualization can’t be used to precisely say how much pollution a community is exposed to, but the denser concentrations of particles indicate where more pollution was modeled to be at ground level. Eventually, Gore hopes this global plume modeling tool — which currently depicts pollution across 9,500 urban areas — will mimic CREATE Lab’s Pittsburgh model, providing new plume modeling as close to real-time as possible. The timeline for such a roll out would likely take years, though, Gore said. When he announced the tool in St. James, Gore noted that this tool alone won’t help reduce pollution, but communities empowered with information could. “The information doesn’t do anything by itself unless you turn it into action,” he said. “If you’ve got neighbors and friends to whom you’ve been talking about this, and you have not been able to strike a spark, show them this … Maybe it’ll make it easier to see clearly.”",https://veritenews.org/2025/10/02/air-pollution-louisiana-cancer-alley-al-gore/
